       1                Recipe  Cream Puff -- see Recipe
       2   Tablespoons  Cornstarch
       2   Tablespoons  Sugar
       1      Teaspoon  Gelatin Powder -- unflavored
       2          Cups  Egg Nog
       1           Cup  Whipping Cream
                        Powdered Sugar -- optional
                        Chocolate Fudge Sauce -- optional

Combine the cornstarch, sugar and gelatin in a glass or enamel saucepan.

Gradually stir in the egg nog.  Blend until smooth before heating.

Cook gently, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens and boils.  Cool, stirring mixture frequently to prevent a "skin" from forming.

When eggnog mixture is cooled completely, beat it until smooth.

Whip the cream until stiff and fold into egg nog mixture.

Fill 12 large cream puff shells.  Top with a frosting of chocolate sauce and refrigerate; or refrigerate and sift powdered sugar over just before serving.
