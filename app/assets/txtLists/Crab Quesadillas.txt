--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  unsalted butter
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
       1                garlic clove -- minced
     1/2        medium  onion -- finely chopped
       1                poblano chili
       1         pound  fresh cooked lump crab meat
     1/4           cup  mayonnaise
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
       1    tablespoon  minced fresh cilantro
      12       10 inch  flour tortillas
   1 1/2          cups  grated jalapeno jack cheese
                        salsa

Place the butter and oil in a medium saucepan and heat over low heat until the butter is melted. Pour all but 2 tablespoons of the mixture into a small cup and add the garlic and onion to the pan. Saute over medium-high heat until translucent, about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the chili, crab, mayonnaise, salt, and cilantro. Mix well. To soften the tortillas, place them on a heated grill or skillet for about 15 seconds on one side, then turn. Brush one side with the butter-oil mixture, turn the tortilla over and spread the crab mixture on one half of the tortilla, and top with a tablespoon of grated cheese. Repeat until all the tortillas are filled. At this point, the quesadillas can either be sauteed or finished in the oven. If sauteing, heat a large saute pan or skillet over medium-high heat. Cook for about 2 minutes on a side, or until golden brown. Or preheat the oven to 375 degrees and bake on a cookie sheet until the tops are golden , about 5 minutes. Cut into quarters and serve.
