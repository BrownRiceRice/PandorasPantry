       1           cup  sifted flour
       1    tablespoon  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/3           cup  shortening
       2   tablespoons  cold milk -- up to 3
     1/3           cup  soft butter
     1/2           cup  sugar
   1 1/2     teaspoons  grated lemon peel
       2         large  eggs
       1    tablespoon  cream sherry
     3/4           cup  finely ground blanched almonds
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  flour
       4     teaspoons  red or green jelly

 Combine 1 cup sifted flour with 1 Tbsp. sugar and 1/2 Tsp. salt.  Cut in  shortening until particles are size of peas.  Stir in 2 to 3 Tbsp. cold milk, add just enough to make a stiff dough.

 Divide dough into 8 portions and shape each into a small ball.

 Roll, 1 at a time, on lightly floured board to 4" circle.

 Fit into plain or fluted tart pans (3 1/2" in diameter, 1 1/4" deep).  Trim edges.

 Set tarts on baking sheet and partially bake pastry in center of moderately hot oven, 375 degrees for 12 minutes.

 Meanwhile, cream butter with sugar and lemon peel until light and fluffy.

 Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition.

 Beat in sherry, almonds and salt.

 Gradually beat in flour (Batter may appear curdled).

 Spoon into hot, partially baked tart shells.

 Return to moderately hot oven for 20 minutes.

 Remove from oven and spoon 1/2 Tsp. jelly onto center of each.

 Return to oven for 3 to 5 minutes longer, until tarts are golden brown.

 Remove from oven.

 Let stand 10 minutes, then remove from pans.

 Cool on wire rack.

Yield:  8 tarts.
