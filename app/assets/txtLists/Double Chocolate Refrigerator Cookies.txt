   2 3/4          cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  cinnamon
       1           cup  butter or margarine -- softened
       1           cup  sugar
       1           cup  packed brown sugar
       4        ounces  semisweet chocolate -- melted

       1      teaspoon  vanilla extract
       2          cups  semisweet chocolate mini chips

Combine flour, baking powder, salt, soda and cinnamon; set aside.  Cream butter or margarine and sugars.  Beat in melted chocolate, egg and vanilla until light and fluffy. Stir in flour mixture and chocolate chips just until blended.  Shape into three 8" rolls.  If dough is too soft, chill slightly before rolling.  Wrap in waxed paper or plastic wrap and then with aluminum foil.  chill several hours or overnight.  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Cut rolls into 1/4" slices with sharp knife.  Bake on ungreased baking sheet 8 to 10 minutes.  Cool on wire rack. Note: If rolls are wrapped tightly, they will keep refrigerated for  a week to 10 days or frozen for 2 months.
