--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       3          cups  dry red wine
       3     teaspoons  salt
       1           cup  olive oil
       3   tablespoons  poupon mustard
       2   tablespoons  wine vinegar
       2   tablespoons  prepared horseradish
       2     teaspoons  onion powder
       3   tablespoons  lime juice
       1      teaspoon  garlic powder
       2     teaspoons  ground cayenne pepper

Mix all of the ingredients really well and then pour over whole beef brisket.  Let marinate for several hours, or overnight if possible. Also, use this marinade as a basting sauce. Some people may find Justin's 3 cups of dry red wine a little bit too much for their taste. No problem, use as much as you like in the sauce, and drink the rest. Sure won't go to waste.
