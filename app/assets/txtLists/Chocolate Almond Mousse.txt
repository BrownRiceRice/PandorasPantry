--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  milk
       4                eggs
     1/4           cup  sugar
       1       package  (6 oz.) semi-sweet chocolate pieces
       1      teaspoon  vanilla
     1/2      teaspoon  almond extract
       2   tablespoons  (2 to 3) slivered almonds

In medium saucepan, stir together milk, eggs and sugar until thoroughly blended. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until mixture is thick enough to coat a metal spoon with a thin film and reaches at least 160F. Remove from heat. Stir in chocolate and flavorings until chocolate is melted. Spoon into 8 pot de creme cups or 1/4-cup dessert dishes. Sprinkle with almonds. Refrigerate several hours or overnight.
MICROWAVE: In small bowl, stir together eggs and sugar until thoroughly blended. In 1-cup liquid measure, cook milk on full power until bubbles form at edges, about 2 1/2 minutes. Stir into egg mixture. Cook on 50% power, stirring every minute, until mixture is thick enough to coat a metal spoon with a thin film and reaches at least 160F, about 3 to 4 minutes. Continue as above.
