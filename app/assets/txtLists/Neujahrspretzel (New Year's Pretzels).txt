       2           cup  milk
       2                eggs -- large
     1/2           cup  butter or margarine
       1           cup  confectioners' sugar
       2       package  yeast; active -- dry
                        water
       2      teaspoon  salt
       1      teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  almonds -- chopped
       7           cup  flour -- unbleached

Heat milk and butter until very warm (120-130 degrees F.).  Mix yeast, salt, sugar, and 1 cup flour.  Slowly beat into warm milk.  Beat for 2 minutes.  Add eggs and 1 cup of flour.  Beat for an additional 2 minutes. Add enough flour to form a soft dough.  Knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes.  Place dough in a greased bowl.  Let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.  Punch dough down and let rise again until doubled. (1 hour more).  Divide dough in half.  Shape pretzel as follows:  Roll dough into a rope about 30 inches long and 1 1/2 inches in diameter.  Cross the ends leaving a large loop in the center.  Flip loop back onto crossed ends to form a pretzel.  Repeat with remaining dough. Place pretzels on greased baking sheets.  Let rise 15 minutes more.  Bake at 375 degrees F for 25 to 30 minutes or until golden brown.  Cool on wire racks.  Mix confectioners' sugar, water and vanilla to form a thin icing. Spread icing on pretzels and sprinkle with chopped almonds. Makes 2 large pretzels.
