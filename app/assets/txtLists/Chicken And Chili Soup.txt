--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1      teaspoon  margarine*
       1        medium  onion -- finely chopped
       1         large  garlic clove -- minced
       1         large  celery stalk -- diced
   4 1/2          cups  chicken stock -- defatted
     3/4           cup  boneless skinless chicken breast -- cooked and cubed
       1           can  green chiles**
   1 1/2          cups  cauliflower flowerets -- chopped
       1           cup  kidney beans -- canned
       2   tablespoons  cornstarch
       1           cup  cheddar cheese -- lowfat
     1/4           cup  cold water

In a medium sized saucepan melt margarine over medium heat.  Add onion,
garlic, celery and 3 tablespoons of broth.  Cook, stirring frequently, until onion is tender (4-5 minutes).  If too much liquid evaporates, add a little more broth. Add remaining broth, cooked chicken, chilies, cauliflower, and kidney beans.  

Bring mixture to a boil, cover, and simmer about 10 minutes (until celery is crisp-tender). Meanwhile, in a small bowl or cup, combine cornstarch and water.  Add mixture to broth and cook, stirring until it thickens, about 1 to 2 minutes. Lower heat so that soup simmers gently. 

In 2 or 3 batches, add cheese to soup, stirring well after each batch.  Stir until cheese melts.  Continue to stir gently simmering soup 2-3 minutes more. Do NOT allow it to come to a full boil. Keeps in refrigerator 1-2 days.
