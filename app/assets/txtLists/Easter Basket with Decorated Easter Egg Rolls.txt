  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   6 1/2          cups  all-purpose flour (6 1/2 to 7 1/2 cups)
     2/3           cup  plus 1 tablespoon sugar
       2      packages  Fleischmann's. Rapid Rise Yeast
       2     teaspoons  grated lemon peel
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
       1           cup  milk
     1/2           cup  water
     1/2           cup  butter or margarine
       3                eggs
       1                egg white
       1           cup  sliced almonds -- lightly toasted
                        Frosting (recipe follows)

                        FROSTING
  1                cup  powdered sugar
  1         tablespoon  milk (1 to 2 tablespoons)

Combine 2 1/2 cups flour, 2/3 cup sugar, undissolved yeast, lemon peel and salt. Heat milk, water and butter until very warm (125: to 130:F). Butter does not need to melt. Gradually add to dry ingredients; beat 2 minutes at medium speed of electric mixer, scraping bowl occasionally. Add 3 eggs and 1/2 cup flour; beat 2 minutes at high speed. With spoon, stir in 3/4 cup nuts and enough remaining flour to make soft dough.

Knead on lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 6 to 8 minutes. Cover; let rest on floured surface 10 minutes.

Reserve 1/4 of dough. Divide remaining dough into two pieces; roll each to 34-inch rope. Loosely twist ropes together. Place on large baking sheet sprayed with cooking spray. Shape into circle; pinch ends to seal. Divide remaining dough into 6 equal pieces; form into oval rolls. Place on separate large baking sheet sprayed with cooking spray. Spray top of wreath and rolls with cooking spray. Cover; let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 30 to 45 minutes. 

Beat egg white with 1 tablespoon water; brush on wreath. Sprinkle with remaining sugar and almonds. Bake at 350:F for 15 to 20 minutes for rolls and 35 to 40 minutes for wreath, or until done. Switch positions of sheets after 8 to 10 minutes for even browning. Remove from sheets; cool on wire racks. Frost rolls and decorate as desired.

Makes 1 basket and 6 rolls
