--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1         stalk  (1-inch) fresh ginger root
       2  medium clove  garlic
       1         large  orange
       2   tablespoons  soy sauce
       1    tablespoon  dark sesame oil
       2         racks  lamb -- chine bones removed

PREPARATION: Peel the ginger and garlic. Remove two 1-inch by 3-inch strips of zest from the orange. Squeeze 1/3 cup orange juice into the workbowl of a food processor fitted with the metal blade. Add the ginger, garlic, soy sauce, and sesame oil, and process until smooth. Put the lamb in a large bowl and rub the meat with the ginger paste. Refrigerate, covered, for 24 hours, turning the racks occasionally in the seasoning paste.

COOKING: Bring meat to room temperature. Adjust oven rack to high position and heat oven to 450:F. Wrap the rib bones in foil to prevent blackening and put the racks meat-side up in a shallow roasting pan. Spread any remaining ginger paste over the meat and roast for 10 minutes. Lower oven to 350:F and roast until the internal temperature of the meat at the thickest point registers 130:F (medium rare), 15-20 minutes.

SERVING: Let racks rest 5 minutes, cut into chops and serve immediately.
