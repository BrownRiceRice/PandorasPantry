--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       2        quarts  popped popcorn
     3/4           cup  pecan halves
     1/2           cup  candy corn
      24                caramels -- about 1/2 lb
       1    tablespoon  water
       1    tablespoon  sugar
                        margarine

Combine popcorn, nuts and candy corn in large bowl; toss to mix. Combine caramels, water and sugar in top of double boiler. Heat over simmering water, stirring frequently, until melted and smooth, about 20 minutes. Pour over popcorn mix; toss to coat evenly. When caramel is cool enough to handle but still soft, shape mixture with buttered hands into 16 balls, about 1/2 cup each. Place on buttered baking sheet to set.
