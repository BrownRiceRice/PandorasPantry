       3          cups  water
       1           cup  lentils
       1                onion -- chopped (recipe
                        called for "small" onion -- i
                        used a large one)
       1                green pepper -- chopped
       2     teaspoons  garlic (i used fresh
                        oil-free garlic from a jar)
       1      teaspoon  red pepper
       1      teaspoon  black pepper
       1      teaspoon  cumin
     1/2           cup  salsa
       1                ff tortillas
                        -----optional garnishes-----
       1                chopped fresh tomatoes
       1                salsa

Put water and beans in saucepan on med high heat. Add all ingredients except salsa and tortillas. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat and let cook til lentils are soft, about 45 minutes. (Keep stirring because the beans will stick to the bottom of the pot.) Once the beans are mushy, add salsa, stir well.

 Place in tortillas, garnish as desired, and enjoy.

 NOTE: I didn't soak the beans beforehand and haven't experienced any problems. Mary McD says, in this book, that you don't need to soak lentils.
