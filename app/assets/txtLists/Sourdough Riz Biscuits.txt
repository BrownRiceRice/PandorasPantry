       2     teaspoons  sugar
       1       package  dry yeast
   2 1/2          cups  all-purpose flour -- sifted
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     3/4           cup  sourdough starter
     1/2           cup  butter

                        cheese

Dissolve yeast in warm milk to which sugar has been added. Mix remaining dry ingredients in medium bowl, cut in butter with pastry cutter to resemble cornmeal. Mix in 1 cup shredded cheese. Blend starter into dissolved yeast and stir all lightly into flour mixture until ball just forms. Roll out 1/2-inch thick on well-floured board, flouring top as needed just to keep from sticking to rolling pin.  Cut out and quickly place on buttered baking pan, barely touching. (work fast, they get sticky quickly). Put in draft-free place to rise, for about 1 hour or in refrigerator for about 4 hours.  Bake at 425: for 25 minutes until nicely browned. Serve warm with butter. ENJOY ENJOY... SALlie... Comment before posting note: Another sourdough starter goodie...Created by Kyllikki Fuller...who was one of the best Sourdough teachers!
