--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       2          cups  fresh raspberries*
     1/3           cup  sugar
       2   tablespoons  orange-flavored liqueur**
       2                cantaloupes
       3          cups  raspberry sherbet

* Or unsweetened frozen raspberries, defrosted **Or raspberry-flavored brandy (optional)  In a blender or food processor, whirl raspberries until pureed.  Pour through a sieve to remove seeds.  Stir sugar and liqueur (if used) into puree and mix well; cover and chill. Halve cantaloupes and remove seeds; peel and cut into thin slices. Line each of 8 small dessert bowls or goblets with 3 or 4 melon slices. Top melon with a scoop of sherbet and pour 2 tablespoons chilled raspberry sauce over sherbet. Raspberry sherbet in goblets lined with sliced cantaloupe and topped with Melba sauce would make a memorable finale for a menu featuring an egg and cheese dish.
