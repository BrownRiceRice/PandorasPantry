       2   tablespoons  olive oil
       2   tablespoons  butter
       2   tablespoons  finely chopped shallots
       2     teaspoons  dried rosemary

Preheat oven to 425 degrees. In a small saucepan, heat oil and butter over medium heat. Add shallots and rosemary and cook 2 to 3 minutes. Add lemonade, pepper and salt. Simmer over low heat for 6 to 8 minutes or until slightly reduced and syrupy. Cool slightly. Meanwhile, cut chicken wings into three pieces, discarding wing-tip joint. Place wings in shallow pan and coat well with sauce. Bake in oven until skin is golden brown, about 30 minutes. Serve with rice or as hors d'oeuvre. Makes 20 to 24 pieces.
