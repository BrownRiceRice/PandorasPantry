      18                young tender corn
       1         large  spring chicken
       1         large  onion, finely chopped
     1/2                bell pepper, chopped
       1         large  tomato, small pieces
       1      teaspoon  salt
       1      teaspoon  sugar
                        black pepper
       2   tablespoons  cooking oil
                        milk, if needed

Cut corn off cob, and then scrape ears with back of knife to obtain milky pulp in a heavy iron pot, brown the chicken in oil a few pieces at a time, until all sides are done.  Add corn, onions and the rest of the ingredients to the pot. Stir mixture frequently while cooking over low flame for 30 minutes.  If mixture is too dry, add a small amount of milk. Will serve four.
