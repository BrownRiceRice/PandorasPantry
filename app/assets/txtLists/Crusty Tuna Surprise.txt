--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1           cup  rice -- uncooked
       2          cups  water
       1           can  cheddar cheese soup
       1           cup  milk
       1           can  tuna -- drained
                        parsley
       3   tablespoons  margarine -- melted
                        corn flake crumbs

I cook the rice in a 2 qt. casserole dish in the microwave. Takes about 18 min. (9 and then turn 9 more). After the rice is cooked, I add the next 4 ingredients. Stir until well mixed.  Then I mix the butter and enough corn flake crumbs to use up the butter and put them on the casserole dish. I then microwave the whole thing for 5-8 min. Corn or peas could be added to the casserole.
