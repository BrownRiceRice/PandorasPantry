--------  ------------  --------------------------------
      12        ounces  fresh white mushrooms
       2   tablespoons  olive oil -- divided
       2         large  garlic cloves -- halved
       4                loin pork chops -- 3/4 inch-thick(about
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  red pepper flakes -- optional
       1           cup  coarsely chopped fresh plum tomatoes
       1         large  yellow or green bell pepper -- cut in 1/4 inch stri

Trim mushroom stems; cut in thick slices; set aside. In a large skillet, over medium heat, heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil until hot. Add garlic; cook and stir until golden, 1 to 2 minutes; remove garlic and discard. In the same skillet, cook pork chops until lightly browned, turning once, 6 to 8 minutes; remove and set aside.

Raise heat to medium high, add wine, salt and red pepper flakes (if using). Cook, stirring to loosen particles, until wine is reduced by half, 2 to 3 minutes. Add tomatoes and return chops to skillet.

Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer, basting occasionally, until chops are tender, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, in a medium-sized skillet, over medium heat, heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil until hot.

Add reserved mushrooms and the bell pepper; cook and stir until vegetables are softened, about 5 minutes.

Add mushroom mixture to skillet with pork chops, Cover and simmer mixture just until hot, about 3 minutes, adding 1 to 2 tablespoons water, if needed.
