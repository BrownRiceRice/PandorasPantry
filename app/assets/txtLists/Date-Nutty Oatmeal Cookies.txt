     3/4           cup  vegetable shortening
                        --butter flavored
   1 1/4          cups  light brown sugar, packed
       1                egg
     1/3           cup  orange juice
   1 1/2     teaspoons  vanilla extract
       3          cups  rolled oats -- quick-cooking
       1           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
       1           cup  sweetened coconut flakes
       1           cup  chopped dates
       1           cup  chopped nuts -- walnuts or pecans

Preheat oven to 375 degrees; grease cookie sheets.  In a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed, beat the shortening, brown sugar, egg, orange juice and vanilla extract until well blended.  In a medium bowl, combine the oats, flour, baking soda, salt and cinnamon.  With the mixer on low speed, beat the flour mixture into the shortening mixture until just blended.  Stir in the coconut, dates and nuts.  Drop the dough by rounded tablespoonfuls 2 inches apart onto the prepared cookie sheets.  Bake one cookie sheet at a time for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the cookies are lightly browned.  Cool for 2 minutes on the cookies sheets.  Remove to racks to cool completely.
