  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       2         dozen  fresh red radishes
       3   tablespoons  Peanut oil
       2     teaspoons  Salt
       1      teaspoon  Sesame oil
       1      teaspoon  White vinegar
     1/4      teaspoon  Fresh ginger juice
       1      teaspoon  Sugar
                        Chinese parsley garnish
       3     teaspoons  Thin soy sauce

Remove heads and tails from radishes; wash. Using bottom of heavy drinking glass, about 2" across base, hit radishes on side to crack them not mash them so dressing can get into flesh. 

Avoid rendering a crushing blow no matter how you feel that day. Sprinkle radishes all over with salt, put them in a bowl, and set aside for about 15 minutes at room temperature.

Prepare dressing Combine vinegar, sugar, thin soy sauce, peanut oil, sesame oil and fresh ginger juice. Double amount of vinegar for a sharper taste, if desired. 

Drain liquid from radishes (salt will have drawn off quite a bit of water); pour dressing over them; cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes.

If you make this dish ahead of time, pour on dressing 30 minutes before serving. Immediately before serving, transfer radishes to serving dish; garnish with Chinese parsley and serve.
