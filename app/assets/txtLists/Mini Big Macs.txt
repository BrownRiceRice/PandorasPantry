       2                vanilla wafers
                        chocolate mint wafer
                        coconut -- flaked
                        honey -- warmed
                        sesame seeds
                        white frosting

Take 2 Vanilla Wafers.  Brush one with warmed honey and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Color flaked coconut let tuce green by diluting food color with water and sprinkling/shaking/rubbing in a plastic bag until color is evenly distributed. Spread on a plate and let dry.

Using white frosting as the mayonnaise/glue, layer cooky, mayo, lettuce, Chocolate mint patty, mayo, and sesame topped cooky to look like a burger. Neat for individual place setting name tags (written on top of bun) or favors to go with the big cake.
