       7        pounds  med. beets
                        vinegar

       2        pounds  med. onions

Cut off all but 2-inches of the beet tops, leave the root ends attached. Peel and slice the onions into 1/4-slices.  Heat enough water to cover beets to boiling.  Add beets and 2 t vinegar for each quart of water used. Cover and heat to boiling.  Cook until beets are tender, 35 to 45 minutes; drain.  Run cold water over beets, slip off skins and remove the root ends.  Cut beets into 1/4-inch slices.  Heat remaining ingredients to boiling in a 6-quart Dutch oven, reduce heat.  Simmer, uncovered 10 minutes, stir in beets.  Pack beets and onions in hot jars, leaving 1/2-inch headspace.  Heat syrup to boiling.  Pour over beets and onions, leaving about 1/2-inch headspace; seal.  Process 30 minutes in boiling water bath. Makes about 8 Pints.
