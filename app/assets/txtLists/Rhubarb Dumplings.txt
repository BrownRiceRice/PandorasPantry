     1/4      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  salt

       2          cups  flour
       2   tablespoons  sugar
       2     teaspoons  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
   2 1/2   tablespoons  cold butter
     1/2           cup  milk (may need up to 3/4 cup
                        -----filling-----
       2   tablespoons  butter -- softened

     1/2           cup  sugar
                        cinnamon

Preheat oven to 350 F.  Prepare sauce first.  In a small saucepan, combine sugar,flour, cinnamon, and salt. Gradually mix in the water, and add the butter. Bring to a boil over high heat and cook for 1 minute. Add the vanilla and,if desired, food coloring to tint dark pink. Let cool. Prepare the dough.  In a medium mixing bowl or food processor, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.  Cut or process in the butter until the mixture resembles small corn niblets. Add the milk and mix quickly.  Roll out dough onto a flowered surface to a 12 x 10 inch rectangle Spread the dough with the softened butter, and arrange the rhubarb on top.  Sprinkle sugar all over, and dust liberally with cinnamon. Roll up from the 07/01/92        9:24 PM long side, and place on a cutting board, seam side down.  Cut the roll into 12 slices. Arrange cut side up on an oiled 3 qt. flat glass baking dish. Poor cooled sauce over the top. Bake for 35 minutes, until the dumplings are puffy and golden brown. Serve with cream if desired.     NOTE: Frozen rhubarb can be used. Do not thaw before arranging on dough.  Cook the same length of time. From Cooking from Quilt Country  by Marcia Adams
