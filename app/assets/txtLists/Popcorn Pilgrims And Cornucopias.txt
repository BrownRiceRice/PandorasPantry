  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  water
       1           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  light corn syrup
       1   (1/2 ounce)  instant orange soft drink mix
     1/2      teaspoon  vinegar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla
   2 1/2        quarts  popped popcorn
                        Licorice strings, gumdrops, jelly beans,
                        Black, white, and yellow construction pape
                        Cardboard, black crepe paper, ribbons, pin
                        As desired to decorate pilgrim faces.

Butter sides of a heavy 2-quart saucepan. Combine water, sugar, corn syrup, orange drink mix, vinegar and salt in saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until sugar dissolves and mixture begins to boil.

Continue cooking until mixture reaches 250 degrees Fahrenheit, or the hard-ball stage on a candy thermometer. Remove saucepan from heat; quickly stir vanilla into mixture and pour over popped popcorn to coat. Put pan of popcorn in hot water to prevent popcorn from hardening while forming shapes.

Lightly butter hands and shape popcorn into eight 4 1/2-inch flat circles for pilgrim faces, using 1 cup popcorn mixtures for each face. Make features for faces from black shoestring licorice, jelly beans, gumdrops or other small candies, using warm syrup for "glue".
