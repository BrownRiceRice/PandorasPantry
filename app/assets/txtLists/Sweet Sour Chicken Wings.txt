       3        pounds  chicken wings
                        garlic salt
                        corn starch
       2                beaten eggs
     3/4           cup  sugar

       4   tablespoons  catsup
       4   tablespoons  soy sauce

Cut wings in three pieces.  Cook wing tips in water (to cover) to make broth. Sprinkle chicken wings with garlic salt. Let stand one hour. Roll in cornstarch, then in beaten egg. Fry until brown and crisp. Put in single layer in flat pan.  Make sauce with rest of ingredients, including broth made from chicken wing tips, cook until sugar melts, then pour over chicken wings.  Bake at 325F about one hour.  Baste and leave uncovered during last 15 minutes.
