       2                chicken breasts*
       6        ounces  snow peas
     2/3           cup  soy sauce
       1      teaspoon  minced fresh ginger
       5        cloves  minced garlic
     1/2    tablespoon  crushed red pepper
       2   tablespoons  cornstarch
     2/3           cup  water
       1      teaspoon  sugar
       2                egg whites
       3   tablespoons  oil
     1/2           cup  dry roasted peanuts

* whole boneless skinless  In a bowl  combine sherry; egg  whites, sugar, 1  Tbsp corn starch. Mix ingredients well.  Cut chicken into bite size pieces and add to egg white mixture; set aside. In another bowl combine the water, 1 Tsbp cornstarch, soy sauce.  Pre- heat wok or large saute skillet on high heat. Add the 3 Tbsp  of  oil.    Add the crushed red pepper, garlic and ginger.Cook for 30 seconds  and  add  chicken   mixture. Cooking times vary according to appliance  used.  Cook  on high heat until done, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat, add 1/2 cup of peanuts.(I like to pulverize mine in a blender or  food  processor  first.    It  adds more of a peanutty flavor to the dish.)   Add the snow peas and soy sauce mixture,cover and simmer until snow peas are cooked to your taste. This dish is best served with plain white rice and is even tastier as a leftover. (It microwaves well) ENJOY! ! FROM:  HERBERT JORGENSEN (DNKX88A)
