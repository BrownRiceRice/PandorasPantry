For Pound Cake Beat cream cheese and butter in large bowl until smooth; gradually beat in 2-1/2 cups sugar. Add egg yolks, one at a time, beating until light and fluffy after each addition. Mix in flour, salt and vanilla.

Using clean beaters, beat egg whites in large bowl to soft peaks. Gradually add remaining 1/2-cup sugar and beat to stiff peaks. Stir 1/4 of the egg whites into batter. Fold batter into remaining egg whites. Fold in chopped glaceed fruit and pecans. Pour batter into greased and floured 12-cup fluted cake pan.

Bake at 325 until toothpick inserted in center of cake comes out clean, about 1-1/2 hours. Cool on wire rack for 20 minutes. Invert cake onto wire rack and cool completely.

For Cream Cheese Glaze Beat cream cheese, sugar and enough lemon juice to make glaze consistency.

To assemble, drizzle cake with Cream Cheese Glaze and garnish with glaceed cherries and pecans. Refrigerate cake. Let stand at room temperature 1 to 1-1/2 hours before serving.
