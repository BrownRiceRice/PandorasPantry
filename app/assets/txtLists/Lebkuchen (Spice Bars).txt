--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1      teaspoon  cinnamon
       1      teaspoon  allspice
     1/4      teaspoon  cloves
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
   2 1/4          cups  flour
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2           cup  almonds -- ground
       1      teaspoon  lemon rind -- grated
       2                eggs; large
     3/4           cup  sugar
     3/4           cup  honey
     1/2           cup  milk
                        --------almond glaze--------
       1           cup  confectioners' sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  almond extract
       1      teaspoon  rum
       1    tablespoon  water

Stir together the spices, salt flour, and baking powder.  Stir in the almonds and lemon rind.  In a separate bowl beat the eggs and sugar until a ribbon is formed when the beater is removed.  Stir in the honey and milk.  Gradually stir in the flour mixture; beat until smooth.  Spread the batter in an 11 X 17-inch jelly roll pan that is well greased and floured.  Bake at 400 degrees F for 12 to 15 minutes, until the cake is done. While the cake is still warm, turn it out onto a wire rack.  To make the almond glaze, mix the confectioners' sugar, almond extract, rum, and 1 to 2 T of water.  Beat until glaze is smooth and of the right consistency. Add more water to thin if necessary.  Spread the warm cake with the almond glaze.  Cut cake into 1 X 2 1/2-inch bars while still warm.  Spice bars keep 6 to 8 weeks in a sealed container if not glazed. Makes 4 dozen bars.
