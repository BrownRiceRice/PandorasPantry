       1       package  (14 ounces) caramels
     1/4           cup  water
       4        quarts  popped popcorn -- salted

Melt caramels with water in double boiler or in a saucepan over low heat. Stir occasionally until sauce is smooth.
Pour over popcorn; toss until well-coated. Moisten hands with cold water and shape popcorn into 12 balls. Insert a wooden stick in each.
Cut from colored paper 12 petal-edged flowers that are 3 inches wider in diameter than the popcorn balls. Place a popcorn ball in center of each flower and fasten with toothpicks. Use in centerpiece cluster or at each place setting.
