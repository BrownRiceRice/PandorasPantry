--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1         pound  large shrimp (deveined)
       1         pound  large mushrooms
     1/4           cup  honey
       8                wooden skewers
       1         pound  fresh sea scallops
      17        ounces  bottled bar-b-q sauce
       4   tablespoons  stone ground Dijon mustard
       2        pounds  fresh fruit (as garnish)

Combine the bar-b-q sauce, honey and mustard in a bowl and mix well. Place alternating groups of shrimp, sea scallops and mushrooms on the skewers. Place completed kabobs in a baking pan. Spoon the marinade over the kabobs and allow to set for 12 hours (or over- night) in the refrigerator. Grill over direct heat for 7 to 8 minutes or until the shrimp have turned pink, turning frequently to prevent burning.  Baste with marinade and use a covered grill to insure smoky flavor. Garnish with fresh fruit.
