--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        DOUGH
       5          cups  all-purpose flour (5 to 5 1/2 cups)
     1/2           cup  sugar
       2      packages  Fleischmann's. Rapid Rise Yeast
       1    tablespoon  freshly grated lemon peel
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     3/4           cup  evaporated milk (6 ounces)
     1/2           cup  water
     1/3           cup  butter or margarine (2/3 stick) -- cut up
       2                eggs
                        Raisins
                        GLAZE
   1 1/4          cups  sifted powdered sugar
       2   tablespoons  evaporated milk (2 to 3 tablespoons)
     1/2      teaspoon  pure vanilla extract

To make dough: Combine 2 cups flour, sugar, undissolved yeast, lemon peel and salt. Heat milk, water and butter until very warm (120: to 130:F); stir into dry ingredients. Stir in eggs and enough remaining flour to make soft dough. Knead on lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 4 to 6 minutes. Cover; let rest 10 minutes.

To shape: Divide dough into 18 equal pieces; roll to 10-inch ropes. Tie each into knot, with one end slightly shorter than other. Place knots, short ends up, 2 inches apart on 2 greased baking sheets. Pinch short end of knot to form head and pointed beak.

Insert 2 raisins for eyes. With fingers, flatten long end of knot. With sharp knife, make 4 to 5 cuts to form tail. Cover; let rise in warm, draft-free place until almost doubled in size, about 20 to 30 minutes.

Bake at 375:F for 12 to 15 minutes or until golden brown, covering with foil after 8 minutes to prevent excess browning. Remove from pans to wire racks. Place racks over jelly roll pans or waxed paper; immediately brush with glaze while warm.
