       1           cup  cornmeal -- sifted
       2          cups  whole-wheat flour -- unsifted
       2     teaspoons  baking soda
   1 1/2     teaspoons  salt
     1/2           cup  raisins -- parboiled
     3/4           cup  molasses
       2          cups  buttermilk -- or sour milk

-Combine corn meal and flour with baking soda and salt; sift together.  Stir in the parboiled raisins, which you have dried off with paper    towel.  Combine molasses and milk, add to flour mixture.  Steam in three well greased covered one quart molds, filled 2/3 full so    as to allow room for expansion, for 3 hours.  Uncover molds and bake in a 250 F oven for 25-30 min.  Re-steam any of the loaves not used immediately after baking before    serving.
