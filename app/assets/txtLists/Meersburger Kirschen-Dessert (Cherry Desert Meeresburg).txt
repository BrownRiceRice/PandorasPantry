In a small pan boil 3 T sugar and the water for a minute to make a thin sugar syrup.  Add syrup to cherries; stir to blend.  Cover and let soak for 20 minutes.  Cut the ladyfingers in half, divide into 4 portions, and place in individual glass dishes.  Arrange cherries on top.  Thoroughly blend cream cheese, 3 T sugar, vanilla extract, and ground almonds.  Whip the cream and carefully fold it into the cream-cheese mixture.  Spoon over the cherries.  Garnish with the chopped pistachio nuts and whole cherries.
