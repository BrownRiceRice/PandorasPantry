                        -----curry sauce-----
   1 1/2   tablespoons  olive oil
       1         small  garlic clove -- minced
       1      teaspoon  curry powder
     1/2           cup  mayonnaise
     1/2           cup  sour cream
       2   tablespoons  orange juice
       1    tablespoon  sugar
       1    tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
       1    tablespoon  chutney

Mix the first five ingredients in a medium bowl to blend. Let the batter stand for 1 hour at room temperature. Mix the crabmeat, bread crumbs, two of the egg whites and the parsley in a large bowl. Season with salt and pepper.  Divide the mixture into 24 mounds. press each mound firmly into a ball.  Roll each crabmeat ball in flour; shake off excess. Immediately before frying, beat the remaining egg whites in a small bowl to stiff peaks.  Fold the egg whites into the batter. Heat the oil in a deep fryer or heavy saucepan to 360F. Dip the crab balls, one at a time, into the batter, coating completely. Carefully lower into the oil. Repeat with the remaining crab balls, cooking until pale and golden brown, about 5 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the fritters to paper towels and drain. Serve with Curry Sauce. Do not overcrowd the fryer or saucepan when making these crab fritters. Make no more than 5 fritters at a time. Be certain to slide the fritters gently into the hot oil. Dropping them into the oil can can cause a dangerous splash. Turn the fritters frequently as they fry, making sure that all sides are browned. Heat the oil in a small heavy skillet over medium heat. add the garlic and saute for 1 minute. Add the curry powder and stir for 1 minute. Transfer the mixture to a blender. Add all of the remaining ingredients and blend until smooth. Pour into a bowl.
