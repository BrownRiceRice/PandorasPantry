--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1         pound  pork spareribs -- cut in half
       3   tablespoons  sugar
       8                green onions -- 4 to 5 inches long
     1/4           cup  soy sauce
       1    tablespoon  rice wine -- or dry sherry
       5   tablespoons  water
       2   tablespoons  rice vinegar -- or white vinegar

Use a sharp knife to cut between the spareribs.  Put the green onions in the bottom of a large saucepan.  Place the spareribs on top of the green onions.  Add the wine, vinegar, sugar, soy sauce, and water.  Cover and bring to a boil over high heat then reduce heat to low.  Cook about 2 hours, then serve hot.  Makes about 4 servings. 

Note: This recipe is really nice, and good for weekends.  I suggest you serve it with white rice to soak up all the liquid.  I think the name is supposed to indicate how simple it is - it's from an old chinese cookbook.
