                        APRICOT-FENNEL BASTING SAUCE
     3/4           cup  apricot all-fruit spread
       3     teaspoons  Dijon mustard
       2     teaspoons  fennel seeds -- crushed
       3   tablespoons  water
                        VEGETABLES
       2        medium  sweet potatoes
     1/2         small  eggplant
       1        medium  yellow summer squash
       1        medium  zucchini
       1        medium  sweet red or green pepper
       1        medium  yellow pepper
       8        medium  mushrooms
       8                cherry tomatoes

TO MAKE THE APRICOT-FENNEL BASTING SAUCE: In a small bowl, whisk together
the all-fruit spread, mustard, fennel seeds and enough of the water to
make a saucy, spreadable consistency.<BR><BR>

TO MAKE THE VEGETABLES: Cut the sweet potatoes, eggplant, squash,
zucchini, red or green peppers and yellow peppers into bite-size pieces.
Place the sweet potatoes in a small saucepan. Add 1" of water, cover and
simmer for 5 to 8 minutes, or until the sweet potatoes are crisp-tender.
Drain, rinse with cold water and drain again.<BR><BR>

Thread the sweet potatoes, eggplant, squash, zucchini, red or green
peppers, yellow peppers, mushrooms and tomatoes on 8 long metal or wooden
skewers to make kebabs.<BR><BR>

Preheat the broiler. Broil the kebabs 5" from the heat or grill over
medium-hot coals for a total of 8 to 10 minutes, or until the vegetables
are tender. Baste several times with the basting sauce. Turn the kebabs
halfway through the cooking time.<BR><BR>
