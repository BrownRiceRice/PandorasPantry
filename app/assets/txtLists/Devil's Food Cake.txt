       1           cup  sweet milk
       1      teaspoon  baking soda
       1      teaspoon  vanilla

 Sift, then measure flour.  Sift again with salt.

 Cream butter until light and lemon colored.  gradually add sugar, beating after each addition.

 Add eggs, unbeaten, one at a time, beating until the mixture resembles fluffy hard sauce.  Blend in chocolate which has been melted and cooled.

 Dissolve the baking soda in milk, then add vanilla.  Add dry and liquid ingredients, a small amount at time.  beating after each addition.

 Turn into a greased loaf pan.  Bake in a moderate oven.

 Frost with Fluffy Frosting and when firm, if desired, pour a thin coating of unsweetened melted chocolate over the top or frost with Fudge Frosting.

This is the one Flayice used to like.
