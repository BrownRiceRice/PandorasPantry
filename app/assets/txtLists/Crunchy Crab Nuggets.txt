     1/2         pound  crab meat
     2/3           cup  processed cheese spread

Cut bread into 1-inch slices; remove crusts. Cut trimmed slices into 1-1/2 inch cubes. Hollow out each cube with sharp knife, leaving a shell about 1/8-inch thick. Brush sides and tops with melted butter. Place on cookie sheet. Bake at 400 degrees for 10 min. or until nuggets are lightly browned and crisp. Remove from oven and cool. Remove all cartilage from crabmeat. In a bowl, blend cheese and egg. Add worcestershire sauce, lemon and pepper seasoning, mustard and garlic powder; gently mix in crabmeat. Fill nuggets with crabmeat mixture, sprinkle paprika over tops. Put on cookie sheet and bake at 400 degrees until hot and bubbly, 5-10 min
