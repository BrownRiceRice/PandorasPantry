--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       6          Ears  field corn -- preferably white
                        Water
       2   tablespoons  butter
       2   tablespoons  bacon grease
       1      teaspoon  salt

 Using a very sharp knife, cut kernels off cobs - do not cut deeply.  The key to perfection is this dish is the manner of removing the kernels - almost knocking them off, disregarding the juice.  After the process is completed, scrape the cob to retrieve the milk.

 Place scraped cobs in a shallow glass baking dish with a little water to draw the remaining juice. Turn occasionally.  After 15 minutes or so, pour juice in with the kernels.

 In an aluminum or stainless steel skillet (iron will discolor) place corn, butter, bacon grease and salt.  Add a small amount of water to make the juices about the consistency of very thin white sauce.

 Uncovered, cook over medium low heat.  When mixture starts to boil, stir often.  In 20 or 25 minutes liquid should be thick and corn tender.

 Serve immediately.

 Serves 4 - 6.

 This dish freezes perfectly with a little variation in preparation.  Cook corn and its milk with salt, fats and a very small amount of water until hot, but do not let boil.  Cool slightly and freeze.  To serve, add more water and cook about the same length of time.
