  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       4          cups  unbleached flour
       2   tablespoons  salt
       2   tablespoons  sugar
       4          cups  lukewarm potato water

Put all ingredients in a crock or large jar and let stand in a warm place uncovered several days.  This is the authors last choice for making a starter, but seems to be in all the cookbooks dealing with Sourdough Starters.  Use only as a last resort.
