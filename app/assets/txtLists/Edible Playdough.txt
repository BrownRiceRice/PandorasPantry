       2          cups  Smooth peanut butter

       2          cups  Dried milk

Get your kids to mix all the ingredients until thoroughly combined.

Have them wash their hands while you cover the kitchen with wax paper to make a work surface for them.

Give them the bowl of playdough and leave them to it. Store in an airtight container.
