--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1 1/2        pounds  flank steak -- trimmed
     1/2           cup  fresh lime juice
       5   tablespoons  olive oil -- separated
       2        cloves  garlic -- peeled and crushed
       1      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  black pepper
      16         large  green onions -- trimmed
      16                (6-inch) corn tortillas -- warmed

In a shallow dish, stir together lime juice, 3 tablespoons olive oil, garlic, salt and pepper. Add the flank steak and marinate in refrigerator 2-4 hours.

Remove steak from marinade. Discard marinade.

Grill steak over medium coals to desired doneness (about 17 minutes for medium-rare), turning once. Transfer to a cutting board, tent with foil, and let stand for 10 minutes before carving.

Brush onions with remaining olive oil and grill for 6-8 minutes, turning once.

Carve steak across the grain into thin slices.

To serve, place several slices of the steak and one of the onions in each corn tortilla and roll.
