       1                lemon grass stalk
     1/4           cup  sugar
       2                cucumber -- med

     1/3           cup  lime juice
                        pepper -- white
     1/2           cup  rice vinegar
     1/2      teaspoon  red pepper flakes
       1                banana pepper -- devein/minced

       2     teaspoons  mint, fresh -- minced
                        salt

Slice lemon grass stalk thinly crosswise.  Peel and halve cucumbers lengthwise, then seed and slice thin crosswise. Relish: Bring lemon grass, vinegar, sugar, red pepper flakes and 1/2 cup water to boil in a saucepan; simmer until reduced to 1/2 cup.  Strain mixture into a bowl and cool slightly; discard solids. Stir in all other sauce ingredients. Sprinkle scallops with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon white pepper. Heat one tablespoon oil in a wok or non-stick skillet. Working in batches to avoid overcrowding, and adding remaining oil as needed, saute scallops, turning once, until seared.
