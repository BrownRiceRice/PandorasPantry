Boil crawfish in unseasoned water. Save as much of the fat as possible while peeling them. Melt butter in a large skillet. Sautee onions, scallions, celery, bell pepper and garlic over moderate heat. Stir frequently with a wooden spoon until vegetables become soft. About five minutes. Add flour and mix well. Remove from heat and stir in the crawfish and fat. Add salt and peppers according to taste. Pour into a 9-inch piecrust and bake at 350 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes.
