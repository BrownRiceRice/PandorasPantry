  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       2          cups  Canola oil
       1           cup  water
     1/2           cup  margarine
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
       1           cup  all-purpose flour
       3                eggs
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon

Heat water, margarine and salt to rolling boil in 3-quart saucepan. Stir in flour. Stir vigorously over low heat until mixture forms a ball, about 1 minute.
Remove from heat. Beat in eggs all at once and continue beating until smooth.
Heat oil to 1-1/2 inch depth in heavy skillet to 360 degrees.
Spoon the dough into a decorator's tube with large star tip for authentic looking churros. Squeeze 4-inch strips of dough into hot oil. Fry 3 or 4 strips at a time until golden brown, turning once; about 2 minutes on each side.
Drain. Mix sugar and cinnamon in brown paper bag. Shake the churros in the sugar mixture.

Description:
  "Churros, or Crullers, are to the Spanish and Mexicans what doughnuts
  are to Americans for coffee breaks."
