Disjoint chicken wings, discarding bony tips. Push flesh to boney end of bone on remaining parts. With sharp knife, remove smaller bone in wing portion containing 2 bones. Press fleshy ends of chicken pieces to flatten so they will stand upright. Dredge chicken in cornstarch mixed with 2 teaspoons salt and white pepper. Set aside to dry 30 minutes. Heat oil to depth of 1/2 inch in heavy skillet and fry chicken until golden brown and tender, about 7 minutes on each side. Drain on paper towels and freeze or refrigerate if not to be used at once. To make dressing, combine oil, vinegar, wine, garlic, mustard, sugar, basil, oregano and tarragon. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Blend well. Combine tomato slices, green pepper and onion slices with dressing and mix well. To serve, bring chicken wings to room temperature and arrange upright over tomatoes in shallow casserole.
