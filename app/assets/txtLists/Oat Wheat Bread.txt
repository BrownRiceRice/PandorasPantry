       1           cup  Oats -- 3 Minute brand
       2   tablespoons  shortening
       2          cups  boiling water
       1       package  active dry yeast
     1/2           cup  milk -- scalded and cooled
     1/2           cup  white corn syrup
       1    tablespoon  sugar
       2     teaspoons  salt
       1                Egg
       2          cups  whole wheat flour
       3    3 1/2 cups  all-purpose flour

Combine oats and shortening in bowl.  Pour boiling water over them and set aside to cool.

Meanwhile, soften yeast in cooled milk (should not be warmer than 110 degrees).

Combine oatmeal mixture with syrup, sugar, salt and egg.  Mix very well.

Add yeast.

Gradually add the whole wheat flour and enough all-purpose flour to make a soft dough.  Knead on a lightly floured board until smooth and elastic.

Place dough in a greased bowl, turning once to grease surface.

Cover and let rise until double in size.  Punch down and divide into 2 sections.

Shape into loaves and place into greased 9x5 inch loaf pans.

Let rise until double in size.

Bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour or until bread sounds hollow when tapped with finger.
