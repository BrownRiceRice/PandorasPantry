                        spalding
       2        pounds  leg of lamb or veal
   1 1/4          cups  butter
       3        medium  onions -- chopped
     1/2           cup  white wine
   1 1/2        pounds  tomatoes -- peeled/strained or
       1    tablespoon  tomato paste diluted with:
       1           cup  water
                        salt & pepper to taste
       1           cup  water
       3          cups  raw rice

Cut meat into 2-inch cubes.  Wash and wipe dry Brown meat in two-thirds of the butter.  Add onions and brown these too. Add wine, tomatoes (or tomato paste), salt, and pepper. Cook for about 5 minutes. Addd water. Cook until meat is tender and about 1 c. sauce remains.

 Cook rice as directed on package.  Melt remaining butter and add it to rice.  Place meat and sauce in bottom of a tube pan or ring mold. Add rice and pack lightly. Turn out onto a platter so meat is on top; the sauce will run down the sides of the rice.
