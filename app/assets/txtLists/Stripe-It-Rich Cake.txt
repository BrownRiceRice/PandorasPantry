--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1       package  cake mix or pudding-included cake mix -- (2 layer size)
       2      packages  lemon pudding & pie filling -- (4-serving size
                        -- each)
       1           cup  granulated sugar
       1           cup  confectioners sugar
       2                Eggs -- slightly beaten
   4 1/2          cups  water
       2   tablespoons  butter or margarine

 Prepare cake mix as directed on package, baking in 13x9 inch pan.

 Remove from oven.  Poke holes at once down through the cake to the pan with the round handle of a wooden spoon (or poke holes with a plastic drinking straw, using a turning motion to make large holes).  Holes should be at 1" intervals.

 Only after poking holes, combine pudding mix with sugars and eggs in saucepan.  Gradually stir in water; add butter.  Cook and stir over medium heat until mixture comes to a full boil.

 Quickly, pour hot [pudding evenly over warm cake, into the holes to make the stripes and over the top to "frost" the cake.

 Chill at least 2 hours.

 Store cake in refrigerator.
