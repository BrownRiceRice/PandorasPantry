--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       3        quarts  unsalted popped popcorn
   1 1/2          cups  sugar
     3/4           cup  light corn syrup
     1/3           cup  butter or margarine
     1/2           cup  water
   1 1/2     teaspoons  salt
       8                candy sticks -- about 5 inches long
                        Colored construction paper
       8         large  flat gum drops or mint patties
                        Tiny flag
                        Toy or candy horses and riders

Place popcorn in large buttered bowl. Combine sugar, corn syrup, butter, water and salt in saucepan. Bring to boiling point, stirring until sugar dissolves.
Cook slowly until syrup reaches the hard-crack stage (290-295 degrees Fahrenheit). Pour syrup in fine stream over popcorn; mix just until popcorn is evenly coated. Shape eight small popcorn balls, 1 1/2 inches in diameter.
Press remaining popcorn mixture into a buttered 9-inch layer cake pan. 
Make a hole 1/2 inch deep and the diameter of the candy stick into each of the balls. Turn popcorn layer out of pan onto waxed paper or flat china plate to cool.
Press ends of candy sticks an even distance apart around edge of popcorn layer so candy sticks stand upright. Cut gum drops in half making two flat, round disks. Press cut surfaces of candy onto popcorn around edge of base.
Cut a 12-inch circle from colored construction paper. Make one cut in circle from outside edge to center. Shape paper into a cone 10 inches in diameter. Paste edges together to hold cone in place; dry.
Make eight holes for stick candy an even distance apart around edge of cone. Place cone top on candy sticks and top each candy stick with a small popcorn ball. Put flag in top of cone and arrange horses between candy sticks.
