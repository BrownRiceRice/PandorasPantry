     3/4           Cup  quick-cooking oats
     1/4           cup  brown sugar

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Wash blueberries; drain on paper towels.

In medium bowl combine all but blueberries; mix well.  

Drop from a teaspoon onto an ungreased cooky sheet.

Make a deep depression in the center of each cooky and fill with 7-8 well-drained blueberries.

Push dough from sides to cover berries and pat down.
