     3/4         pound  snap sugar peas -- salt to taste
       2   tablespoons  olive oil
       1         large  sweet red pepper; cored
   1 1/4        pounds  sea scallops -- if too
                        ground pepper
       4   tablespoons  shallots or scallions
       1      teaspoon  garlic -- finely chopped

Pluck off the ends of the peas and discard.  Place peas in a saucepan, cover with water and add salt. Bring to a boil, drain and set aside. In a large nonstick skillet or wok, heat olive oil over high heat. Add snap peas and red pepper and cook, stirring and tossing, for 2 minutes. Add scallops and salt and pepper. Cook for 1 minute, stirring and tossing. Add shallots, garlic, vodka, lemon juice, cream and the coriander. Cook and stir for about 3 minutes or until scallops are heated through. Do not overcook.  Serve immediately
