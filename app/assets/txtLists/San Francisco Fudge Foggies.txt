       1         pound  bittersweet chocolate -- finely chopped
       1           cup  unsalted butter -- cut into
     1/3           cup  strong brewed coffee
       4         large  eggs -- at room temp
   1 1/2          cups  sugar
     1/2           cup  flour
       8        ounces  walnuts -- chopped

Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 375:. Line a 9x13" baking pan with a double thickness of aluminum foil so that the line foil extends 2" beyond the sides of the pan. Butter the bottom and sides of the foil-lined pan. In the top of a double boiler set over hot, not simmering water, melt the chocolate, butter and dissolved coffee, stirring frequently, until smooth. Cool the mixture, stirring occasionally for 10 minutes. In a large bowl, using a handheld electric mixer set at high speed, beat the eggs for 30 seconds, or until foamy. Gradually add the sugar and continue to beat for 2 minutes, or until the mixture is very light and fluffy. Reduce the mixer speed to low and gradually beat in the chocolate mixture until just blended. Using a wooden spoon, stir in the flour. Stir in the walnuts. Do not overbeat the mixture. Transfer the batter to the prepared pan. Bake for 28-30 minutes, or until the foggies are just set around the edges. They will remain moist in the center. Cool the foggies in the pan on a wire rack for 30 minutes. Cover the pan tightly with aluminum foil and refrigerate overnight or for at least 6 hours. Remove the top foil and run a sharp knife around the edge of the foggies. Using two ends of the foil as handles, lift the foggies onto a large plate and peel off the foil. Invert them again onto a smooth surface and cut into 16 rectangles. Makes 16 foggies.
