   1 3/4         pound  dried codfish
       1         clove  garlic -- minced
                        flour -- for dredging
       3    tablespoon  fresh parsley -- minced
       4    tablespoon  butter
                        salt and pepper to taste
       2    tablespoon  olive oil
       1                lemon -- juiced

Put the cod in a deep dish, add cold water to cover, and let it soak for 2 days in the refrigerator in order for it to "plump" up and change the water several times. Rinse and dry the fish and cut it into 2-inch chunks. Dredge the fish in the flour, shaking off the excess. In a large skillet, heat 2 Tbl of the butter and the olive oil. Add the fish pieces and brown them well on all sides over medium-high heat. Sprinkle the fish with the minced garlic and parsley and stir the mixture gently. Cut the remaining 2 Tbl butter into bits and add it to the pan. Sprinkle the fish with salt and pepper and pour over the lemon juice. Serve immediately.
