   2 1/2           cup  40% bran flakes cereal
   1 1/2           cup  raisins
   1 3/4           cup  milk
       1           cup  stirred whole wheat flour
       1           cup  soy flour
       1           cup  toasted wheat germ
       4      teaspoon  baking powder
   1 1/2      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
       4         large  eggs -- slightly beaten
     2/3           cup  honey
     2/3           cup  vegetable oil
     1/4           cup  dark molasses

Combine Bran Flakes, raisins and milk in large mixing bowl.

 Stir together whole wheat flour, soy flour, wheat germ, baking powder, nutmeg and salt; set aside.

 Combine eggs, honey, oil and molasses in small bowl; blend well.  Add egg mixture to soaked bran flakes; mix well.

 Add dry ingredients all at once to bran mixture, stirring just enough to moisten.  Spoon batter into paper-lined 3-inch muffin-pan cups, filling 2/3rds full.

 Bake in 350 degrees F. oven 25 minutes or until golden brown.  Serve hot with butter and homemade jelly or jam.
