      12          cups  popped popcorn
      12        ounces  cocktail peanuts
      12        ounces  butterscotch-flavored morsel
       1           cup  corn syrup
     1/4           cup  butter

Preheat oven to 300:. Place popcorn and nuts in greased large roasting pan; set aside. In a heavy 3-quart saucepan, combine butterscotch morsels, corn syrup and butter. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture boils. Pour butterscotch mixture over popcorn; stir to coat well. Bake 45 minutes, stirring frequently. Remove from oven; stir every 10 minutes until slightly cooled. When cool, store in a tightly covered container. Makes about 3 1/2 quarts.
