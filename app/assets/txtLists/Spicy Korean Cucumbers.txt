       3                cucumbers
       5                chopped green onions
       4         large  clove  garlic
                        sesame oil

     1/4           cup  white vinegar
       1      teaspoon  korean chile powder -- (mexican won't do, get
                        from asian food shop)

Slice ends off the cucumbers and rub against the ends to get the bitterness out. (A white frothy paste will form). Peel cucumbers and slice in about 1/8th inch slices. Add finely chopped garlic and green onions. Add approximately 1/4 cup soy sauce and 1/4 cup white vinegar with 1 tablespoon sesame oil.  Add 1/4 teaspoons chile powder at a time and add more for taste.  Marinate, chill, and serve. Recipe can be doubled easily.
