--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       3          cups  brown sugar
       3          cups  margarine
       6          cups  oatmeal
       3          cups  flour
       1    tablespoon  baking soda
       2          cups  chocolate chips

Put the ingredients in large bowl. Mash, squeeze, knead, etc until it is completely blended. Form into small balls about 1 to 1 1/2 inches in size. Place on an ungreased cookie sheet. Butter the bottom of a small glass and dip into white sugar, then pound the cookies flat. Bake at 350 degrees for about 10 to 12 minutes. This is a good recipe to use when you need to get rid of some aggressions because the dough is too heavy for most mixers. So you have to use your hands and beat it!!  You can also use peanut butter or butterscotch chips or a mixture of them.
