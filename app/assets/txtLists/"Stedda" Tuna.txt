       1                celery stalk
       1         large  carrot -- peeled
       2   tablespoons  onion -- minced
       1    tablespoon  green onion -- minced
     1/2           cup  fresh parsley -- chopped
     1/4           cup  fresh dill -- chopped -- or--
       2   tablespoons  dried dill
       1           cup  thick tahini
     1/3           cup  lemon juice
       2   tablespoons  soy sauce
       2     teaspoons  kelp powder

In a food processor or by hand, chop celery, carrot, onion and green onion, parsley and dill until fine. Transfer into a medium bowl and set aside. By hand or in a food processor or blender, puree the tahini, lemon juice and soy sauce with 1/2 boiling water. Add tahini mixture to chopped vegetables. Thoroughly combine by briskly beating with a fork. Add a little water, if mixture is too thick, then add kelp powder. Yields 2 cups. NOTE: Thick tahini like peanut butter is preferable.  If you can only get the watery variety, cut down on the water you add.
