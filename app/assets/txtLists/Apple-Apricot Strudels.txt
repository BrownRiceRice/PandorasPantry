Heat oven to 375 degrees. Mix apples, apricots, almonds, granulated sugar, bread crumbs, lemon juice and nutmeg. Fold 1 phyllo leaf in half crosswise and brush with margarine. (Keep remaining phyllo leaves covered with a dampened towel to prevent them from drying out.) Place about 2/3 cup of the apple mixture in center of phyllo leaf 1 inch from narrow end of leaf. Fold sides of phyllo toward center, overlapping sides slightly. Roll up, beginning at filling end. Place seam side down on ungreased cookie sheet.
