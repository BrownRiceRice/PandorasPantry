Brown off duck breasts in some olive oil. Make a roux with oil and flour (see Justin's recipe posted earlier). Add onions, bell pepper, green onions, and parsley to roux.  Stir and cook.  Add one cup water and garlic.  Cook.  Add wine and some more water.  Add other seasonings and tomato sauce.  Mix well. Add andouille (or smoked sausage) and duck breasts.  Stir. Simmer on low heat for 3 to 4 hours. Stir occasionally.  Add more salt and cayenne to your taste. Makes about 3 gallons, so this is for alot of people.  Serve over spaghetti or rice.
