       1           cup  chickpeas -- dry
       5          cups  water
       6                bay leaves -- or so
     3/4           cup  chopped onion
       1                garlic clove
     2/3           cup  tomato puree
       2   tablespoons  lemon juice
     3/4      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/4      teaspoon  paprika
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne
     1/4      teaspoon  black pepper
     3/4      teaspoon  salt

Sort and rinse the chick-peas, then soak overnight in water.  Drain them, then add 5 cups of water and bay leaves.  Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium and cook for approximately 1 1/2 hours, or until the beans are completely soft.  When cooked, drain the beans and puree until completely smooth in a food processor with the rest of the ingredients.
