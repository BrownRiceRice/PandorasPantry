       1           cup  warm water
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
       1       package  active dry yeast
       3          cups  flour -- divided
       2   tablespoons  oil
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
      12        ounces  mozzarella cheese -- shredded
       6        ounces  creamy goat cheese
       3        ounces  proscuitto -- sliced cut
       3   tablespoons  chives -- chopped
       1    tablespoon  garlic -- minced
       2   tablespoons  parmesan cheese -- grated

Combine water and sugar in large bowl; sprinkle with yeast. Let stand 5 minutes to soften.  Add 1 1/2 cups flour; Beat with mixer until smooth. Stir in oil and salt. Gradually blend in enough of remaining flour with wooden spoon to make moderately stiff dough. Turn out onto lightly floured surface.  Knead until smooth. Return to bowl; cover and let rise in warm place until doubled/ Punch down dough; divide into three equal portions. Roll one potion on lightly floured surface to a 9 inch circle. Place 1/3 of the mozzarella on one side of the dough; dot with 1/3 of the goat cheese and top with 1/3 of the proscuitto. Repeat with remaining dough, cheeses and proscuitto. Mix chives and garlic; sprinkle over filling. Moisten edges of dough with water and fold over to enclose filling. Press edges firmly together.  Place on lightly greased baking sheets. Let rise for 30 to 45 minutes or until dough feels light to the touch. Cut slit in each calzone to allow steam to escape. Preheat oven to 375 F. Bake 30 to 45 minutes or until browned. Remove from oven; brush tops with oil. Sprinkle each with grated parmesan cheese. Serve warm.
