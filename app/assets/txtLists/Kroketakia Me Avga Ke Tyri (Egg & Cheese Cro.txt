       3          cups  kefalotiri cheese -- grated
       1      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
       5                egg whites
                        oil or butter for frying

Mix together cheese, baking powder, and salt.  Beat egg whites until stiff but not dry.  Slowly add cheese mixture to egg whites, beating constantly.  Mixture should be very thick (if necessary, add a little flour until the mixture is the right consistency).  Shape into croquettes about 1 1/2" long.  Fry in hot oil (or butter) to a light golden color. Drain on absorbent paper and serve hot.
