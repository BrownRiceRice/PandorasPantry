--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1 1/4        pounds  top round steak -- cut 1-inch thick
       6   tablespoons  frozen margarita drink mix concentrate -- defrosted
       2   tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro
       2   tablespoons  vegetable oil
       4        cloves  garlic -- crushed
       2     teaspoons  ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  pepper
       1         large  avocado -- diced
     1/2           cup  chopped red onion

In a small bowl, make marinade by combining margarita drink mix, cilantro, vegetable oil, garlic, cumin, salt and pepper. Put 2 tablespoons of the marinade in a small container, cover and refrigerate.

Place the beef steak and remaining marinade in a resealable plastic bag. Seal bag carefully and turn to coat steak. Refrigerate 6-8 hours, or overnight, turning occasionally.

Remove steak from marinade and discard marinade. Place steak on grid over medium ash-covered coals. Grill uncovered for 16-18 minutes for medium-rare doneness turning occasionally. Remove steaks and keep warm.

Just before serving, in a medium bowl, combine avocado, onion and reserved 2 tablespoons of marinade mixture. Toss gently to coat.

Carve steak crosswise into thin slices. Serve immediately with avocado mixture.
