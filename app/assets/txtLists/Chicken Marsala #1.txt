       4                chicken; cutlets -- skinless
       3    tablespoon  olive oil
     1/4           cup  flour
     1/2           cup  chicken broth
                        salt & pepper
     1/2           cup  marsala wine

In a hot no-stick pan Dust chicken cutlets w/flour and saute in oil until golden brown on both sides. Do it quickly and lightly. Remove from skillet and set aside. Add 1/2 cup dry Marsala wine to the pan and scrape up the brown bits that are on the bottom. Add 1/2 cup chicken stock and mix very well, reducing the liquid in the pan by about 1/3. Return chicken to the pan and heat through; about 2 minutes. Serve. A few T of butter could be incorporated; but I hardly ever do. It does make the dish a bit richer.
