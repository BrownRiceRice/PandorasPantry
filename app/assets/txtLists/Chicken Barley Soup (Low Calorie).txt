       3        pounds  chicken -- cut in pieces
     1/2           cup  barley -- uncooked
       9          cups  water
       2   tablespoons  lemon Juice
       3        stalks  celery -- with leaves
       1         small  onion
     1/2           cup  onion -- chopped
     1/2           cup  carrot -- finely chopped
     1/2           cup  parsley -- chopped fresh
       1    tablespoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  pepper -- freshly ground
     1/4      teaspoon  celery seed
       1           cup  green beans -- fresh, cut

Place chicken, water, leaves from celery and small onion in a large saucepan.  (Reserve celery stalks.) Cover saucepan and bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer 1 1/2 hours until chicken is tender.  Remove chicken. Strain broth into bowl; chill until fat sets on top.  

Remove fat. Remove skin and bones from chicken, discard.  Cut chicken into bite-sized pieces, set aside.  (My note:  if you want less than 8 servings, freeze extra broth and chicken separately in meal-sized portions.) Return broth to saucepan. Chop reserved celery stalks, add to broth with chopped onion, carrot, parsley, barley, lemon juice, seasonings. 

Cover and simmer 20 min. Add fresh green beans and chicken; continue cooking 15 min or until beans are tender.  Each  serving 1 1/2 cup.
