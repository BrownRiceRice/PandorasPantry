  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   3 1/2          cups  all-purpose flour (3 1/2 to 4 cups)
       3   tablespoons  sugar
       1       package  Fleischmann's. Active Dry or Rapid Rise
                        Yeast
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  water
     1/2           cup  dairy sour cream
     1/4           cup  butter or margarine
       1                egg
     1/2           cup  chopped red candied cherries
                        ALMOND FILLING
     1/2           cup  almond paste (5 ounces)
       1                egg white
     1/2           cup  blanched almonds -- toasted
                        ICING
       1           cup  confectioner's sugar
       2   tablespoons  milk
     1/4      teaspoon  almond extract

In large bowl combine 3/4 cup flour, sugar, undissolved yeast, and salt.
Heat water, sour cream and butter until very warm (120: to 130:F). Gradually add to dry ingredients; beat 2 minutes at medium speed of electric mixer, scraping bowl occasionally. Add egg and 1/2 cup flour; beat 2 minutes at high speed. With spoon, stir in enough remaining flour to make soft dough. 
Knead on lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 4 to 6 minutes. Place in greased bowl, turning to grease top. Cover; let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 1 hour. (With Rapid Rise Yeast, cover kneaded dough; let rest on floured surface 10 minutes. Proceed with recipe.)
Prepare Almond Filling: Combine almond paste with 1 egg white. Beat with fork until blended. Stir in chopped, blanched almonds, toasted.
Punch dough down. On lightly floured surface, roll dough to 9- W 16-inch rectangle. Spread filling to within 1/2-inch of edges; sprinkle with cherries. Roll up from long side as for jelly roll; pinch seam to seal. Form into ring and pinch ends to seal. Place ring, seam side down, on greased baking sheet. With sharp knife, cut slits, 3/4 through dough, at 1-inch intervals. Turn each section on its side. Cover; let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 30 to 45 minutes.
Bake at 375:F for 25 minutes or until done. Remove from baking sheet; cool on wire rack. Frost with Almond Icing.
