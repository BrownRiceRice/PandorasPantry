                        salt and pepper
       1           cup  butter
       8        slices  mozzarella cheese
       2   tablespoons  chopped parsley
     1/4      teaspoon  sage

Turn the chicken breasts smooth side down and sprinkle up side with a little salt and pepper.  Dot each breast with about a teaspoon of butter. place a slice of mozzarella cheese on each piece of chicken and roll up jellyroll fashion.  Secure well with wooden toothpicks.

Roll the chicken rolls in the flour, then in the beaten egg, then in the dry bread crumbs. place side by side in a baking dish.  pour melted butter and spices over the chicken.  Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.  Pour the wine over the chicken and return to the 350 degree oven for 30 minutes.
