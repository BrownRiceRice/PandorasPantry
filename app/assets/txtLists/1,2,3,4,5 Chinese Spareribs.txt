Ingredients:

        1-2 lbs  spare ribs, each cut in thirds for smaller pieces

          1 Tbsp cooking wine (rice wine works well)
          2 Tbsp sugar
          3 Tbsp vinegar
          4 Tbsp soy sauce
          5 Tbsp water

Directions:

Heat a large skillet with some oil in it, and start to brown the spare
ribs.  Once the ribs are seared and browned, add the rest of the
ingredients. Mix well and bring to a boil.  Cover and reduce heat to
medium-low.  Cook for about 20-25 minutes, and it's ready to serve!

Note:

When cutting the spare ribs into thirds, you can do it with a
well-sharpened cleaver.  However, getting the butcher to saw them with a
belt saw is usually better, as the cleaver creates bone fragments which
are unpleasant when eating the ribs. The saw, on the other hand, makes a
nice clean cut.
