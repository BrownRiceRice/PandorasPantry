  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   4 3/4          cups  all-purpose flour (4 3/4 to 5 1/4 cups)
       3   tablespoons  sugar
       2      packages  Fleischmann's. Rapid Rise Yeast
   1 1/2     teaspoons  salt
       1           cup  very warm water (120 to 130:F)
     1/3           cup  butter or margarine -- softened
       4                eggs

In large bowl, combine 1 1/2 cups flour, 2 tablespoons sugar, undissolved yeast and salt. Add very warm water and butter; blend well. Stir in 3 eggs, 1 egg yolk (reserve egg white) and enough remaining flour to make soft dough. Knead on lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 6 to 8 minutes. Cover; let rest on floured surface 10 minutes.

Divide dough into two equal pieces. Reserve one piece. Divide remaining dough into three equal pieces; roll to 12-inch ropes. Place ropes on greased baking sheet; braid. Pinch ends to seal. Repeat with remaining dough to make second loaf. Cover; let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 30 to 45 minutes.

Lightly beat reserved egg white, brush on loaves. Sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon sugar. Bake at 400:F for 20 to 25 minutes or until done; switch positions of sheets in oven halfway through baking time. Cover with foil if needed during last 5 minutes to prevent excess browning. Remove from sheets; cool on wire racks. 

Preparation Time: 45 minutes, excluding rising time. 
Cooking Time: 20 to 25 minutes
