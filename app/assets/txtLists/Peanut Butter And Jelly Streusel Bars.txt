--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  vegetable shortening
   1 1/4          cups  light brown sugar, packed
     3/4           cup  creamy peanut butter
       3   tablespoons  milk
       1    tablespoon  vanilla extract
       1                egg
   1 3/4          cups  all-purpose flour
     3/4      teaspoon  baking soda
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
       1           cup  strawberry jam -- stirred
                        --or your favorite flavor
     1/2           cup  rolled oats -- quick-cooking

Preheat oven to 350 degrees; grease a 13 x 9 x 2-inch baking pan.  In a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed, beat the shortening, brown sugar, peanut butter, milk and vanilla extract until well blended.  Add the egg; beat just until blended.  In a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking soda and salt.  With the mixer on low speed, add the flour mixture to the shortening mixture; mix just until blended.  Press 2/3 of the dough in the bottom of the prepared pan in an even layer.  Spread the jam evenly over the dough to within 1/4-inch of the sides.  Combine the remaining dough with the oats; drop by spoonfuls onto the jam layer.  The dough will be stiff.  Press lightly to even out the dough layer.  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the edges and streusel topping are lightly browned.  Cool completely in the pan on a wire rack.  To serve, cut into bars.
