      13        ounces  minced clams -- (2 sm cans)*
     1/2           cup  seasoned bread crumbs
   1 1/2     teaspoons  garlic powder
                        or 2 garlic cloves -- minced

*(RESERVE JUICE of clams!!) Saute garlic, onion, parsley, oregano and breadcrumbs in olive oil about 2 minutes. When onion & garlic start to brown, add clams, juice and salt. Mix. Spoon into clams shells. (Mixture is very soupy until baked). Sprinkle with parmesan cheese and place on cookie sheet in 375 degree oven for 25 minutes. This recipe can be doubled or multiplied to make as many as necessary for hors d'ouevres.
