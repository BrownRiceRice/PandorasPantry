--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       2          cups  unbleached flour
       1      teaspoon  dry mustard
       1      teaspoon  paprika
     1/4      teaspoon  baking powder
       1           cup  butter -- at room temperature
      10        ounces  sharp cheddar cheese -- grated
       1      teaspoon  worcestershire sauce

Combine the flour, dry mustard, paprika and baking powder in a medium bowl. Beat the butter, either by hand or with an electric mixer at medium speed, until light and fluffy.  Slowly beat in the cheddar cheese and Worcestershire sauce.  Gradually add the flour mixture, stirring with a fork, until well blended. On a lightly floured surface, shape the dough into a long roll about 1 3/4-inches in diameter. Wrap in plastic wrap or foil. Place on a platter and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, better overnight. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Slice the dough about 1/3 inch thick. With your hands, roll each slice into a ball. Flatten slightly and place on an ungreased baking sheet about 2 inches apart. Bake 8 minutes in the preheated oven. Biscuits will only brown slightly on the bottom. From the Tillamook Factory Cheese Cookbook, 4175 Highway 101 North, Tillamook, OR 97141.
