--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       2        pounds  frying chicken -- cut up in 2 inch pie
       1                thumb size  ginger root -- OR
       2     teaspoons  powdered ginger
       2         large  tomatoes -- quartered
       1         small  garlic cloves -- mashed
     3/4         pound  mongo beans -- boiled and peeled
       2    tablespoon  patis or fish sauce
       1           can  anchovy -- fish fillets may be
       1      teaspoon  MSG
       2    tablespoon  oil

Fry chicken in oil until slightly brown, stirring constantly. Add ginger and garlic and stir until garlic is browned. Add tomatoes until soft, then add 4 cups of water. Add anchovy and cook if it is used instead of patis. Bring to boil, then simmer until chicken is tender. While chicken is simmering, boil beans in water until they are easy to peel.  

This is done by placing a bean between your fingers and rubbing the skin off the beans. When this is done with ease, remove from stove and drain. Add cold water to beans and then rub beans between your palms until almost all of the beans have been peeled. Keep   replacing cold water and peeling will drain with water. When chicken is tender, add beans to soup and cook until soup is thick and beans are soft. Add water, if necessary, 5 minutes before it is done add the patis if anchovies are not available. Variation: Bitter melons, cut in squares or leafy vegetables such as spinach may be used. Pork may be used instead of   chicken.
