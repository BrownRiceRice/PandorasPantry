       3          cups  self-rising flour
       3   tablespoons  granulated sugar
       1      teaspoon  oregano
       1      teaspoon  basil
       1      teaspoon  thyme
      12        ounces  beer -- at room temperature
     1/2           cup  parmesan cheese
       1    tablespoon  shortening
       3    tablespoon  cornmeal
       2    tablespoon  butter or margarine -- soft

In large mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, cheese and dried herbs. Mix well. Stir in the room temperature beer.  It will produce a stiff batter. Preheat oven to 325F . Grease a large loaf pan with the shortening, sprinkle bottom and sides with cornmeal. Turn batter into pan.  Bake at 325 for about one hour. Brush baked loaf with softened butter and sprinkle with additional cornmeal if desired. Turn out and cool on rack.
