       1           cup  cornbread crumbs
     1/2                onions -- red
     1/2                bell peppers
     1/2                bell peppers -- red
       2                garlic cloves -- crushed
       1    tablespoon  olive oil
     1/2         pound  crabmeat
     1/4         pound  shrimp
     1/4         pound  flounder fillets
     1/8         pound  scallops
     1/4           cup  mayonnaise
       1    tablespoon  lime juice
       2        dashes  cayenne pepper
       3   tablespoons  butter -- clarified

Cut onion into 1/2" chunks; saute in 10" frying pan in hot olive oil until soft, about 4 minutes.  Cut peppers into 1/2" chunks; add peppers and garlic, then continue cooking until peppers are almost tender. Meanwhile, peel shrimp.  Coarsely chop shrimp, scallops and flounder. Remove onion/pepper mixture from heat and add seafood, mayonnaise and lime juice. Stir gently to prevent breaking up crab. Season to taste with salt and white pepper. Shape into patties and coat both sides with cornbread crumbs. (May now be placed on a plate and refrigerated for up to an hour) When ready to serve, heat 2 tb clarified butter in frying pan over moderately high heat.  Saute 3 cakes at a time until golden on both sides, about 2 minutes. Add more butter as necessary.
