      12        slices  Jalapeno Jack cheese
       4                eggs -- beaten
       4        strips  turkey bacon -- chopped
       2                green onions -- thinly sliced
       8        slices  sourdough bread
                        Butter -- softened

Chop 4 cheese slices; combine with eggs and set aside. Saute turkey bacon and green onions in butter until onions are translucent.

Add egg and cheese mixture; cook, stirring over medium heat until eggs are set. Remove and keep warm. Butter all slices of bread on one side. Place 4 slices of bread, buttered side down, in clean skillet.

Top each with one slice of cheese and an equal amount of scrambled eggs. Place one slice cheese over eggs on each sandwich; top with remaining bread, buttered side up.

Cook over medium-low heat, turning once carefully, until bread is golden brown and cheese is melted.
