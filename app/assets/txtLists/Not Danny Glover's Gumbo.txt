       1       package  frozen corn kernels
       1       package  frozen okra
                        vegetable oil
                        bay leaves
                        oregano
                        basil
                        allspice

                        salt
                        black pepper

Make vegetable stock by boiling at least one carrot, several bay leaves, and any leftover root vegetables for 45 mins in 6 cups of water.  Add the black-eyed peas and simmer about 30 mins.  Chop the onion, celery, and the bell pepper.  Remove all the celery leaves from the top of the bunch, rinse well, and chop them too.  Saute the onion in a little oil. Add the celery, with leaves, and after a few mins., the bell pepper. Sprinkle generous amounts of the spices in the pan, and saute another minute. Remove the carrot, vegetable pieces, and the bay leaves from the stock. Add the onion mixture and chopped tomatoes to the stock, and stir well, adding more water if necessary.  Let simmer about 10 mins. Chop the okra and stir in with the frozen corn; simmer another 10 mins. Adjust the spices to taste, and serve, ideally with cornbread.
