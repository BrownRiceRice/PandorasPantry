--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  butter
     3/4           cup  milk
       1           cup  wheat germ
   1 1/2          cups  beer
       2     envelopes  dry yeast -- fast acting
       2   tablespoons  honey
     1/3           cup  molasses
       6          cups  whole-wheat flour

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.

Warm butter and milk over low heat.  Add wheat germ to milk mixture. Stir. Gradually hear beer until just below the boiling point. Add yeast to beer.  After it foams (about 8-12 minutes), add milk mixture. Stir honey, molasses, and whole wheat flour into liquids.  Mix well. If dough is too sticky, add more flour. Knead on a lightly floured surface until dough is smooth. Place dough in a greased bowl.  Roll dough to coat surface.  Cover with a floured towel.  Allow to rise in a warm area until double in volume. Turn dough onto lightly floured pastry board and knead for 2-4 minutes. Divide into 2 equal parts and place in 2 well greased loaf pans, 8-1/2 x 4-1/2 inches. Cover again and allow to double.  Bake for 1 hour.  Cool on racks.
