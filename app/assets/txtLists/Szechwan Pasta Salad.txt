       4   tablespoons  toasted sesame seeds
     1/4         pound  snow peas
                        red bell peppers
       1         bunch  cilantro
       1           can  water chestnuts -- dressing-
       2          cups  mayonnaise
     3/4           cup  soy sauce

       1    tablespoon  dijon mustard
       2                garlic cloves -- or more

Cook pasta until Al Dente.  Dice turkey, bell pepper and peeled carrots. Drain and slice water chestnuts. Remove stems from cilantro and use leaves only, saving a few leaves as garnish. Chop green onions. Slice mini corn cobs.  Slice snow peas on diagonal into thin strips.  Toast sesame seeds and reserve 1 TBL for garnish.  Toss all ingredients together. Dressing: Combine all ingredients in food processor and process until well-blended. Add to salad and toss.  Garnish with toasted sesame seeds and cilantro. Makes 14 cups. Recipe from LEXI KERN As used by Terry Grant at her restaurant in Tucson.

 NOTE:  I double the turkey, snow peas and corn cobs in this recipe. The dressing is also wonderful for turkey or chicken salad with jicama, red pepper, and green onions.
