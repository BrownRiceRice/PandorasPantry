     3/4         ounce  semisweet chocolate chips
     1/2           cup  butter
      10   tablespoons  sugar
       4                eggs; separated -- room temp
       2   tablespoons  flour
                        -----whipped topping-----
       1          pint  whipping cream
       1    tablespoon  sugar
                        -----glaze-----
     1/2          pint  heavy cream
       2     teaspoons  instant coffee
   1 1/4          cups  semisweet chocolate chips
                        raspberry preserves (opt)

Melt together butter and 3/4 cup chocolate chips. Set aside and let cool. Mix together 10 tbls sugar, 4 egg yolks, and 2 tbls flour. Make sure this is well mixed, add the chocolate mixture when it is cooled. Mix well. Beat egg whites until stiff, and fold into the chocolate mixture. Blend well, but gently. Spread batter evenly into a 9x13" pan. Bake at 350: for 18 minutes. This will puff up and then fall when removed from the oven. When cool, spread with a THIN layer of Raspberry preserves. Whipped Cream Layer: Beat 1 pint cream with 1 Tbls of sugar, until stiff. Spread evenly on cooled cake. Refrigerate. GLAZE: Melt together heavy cream, instant coffee and chocolate chips. When this mixture is melted and well blended, take off of heat and let cool. Stir well and pour on top of whipped cream layer of cake. Tilt the pan so the glaze distributes evenly over the cream. This may seem like it will not work, but it will. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
