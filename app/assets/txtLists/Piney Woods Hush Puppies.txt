  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   2 1/2          cups  yellow corn meal
       1      teaspoon  salt
       1      teaspoon  soda
       2   tablespoons  granulated sugar
       2   tablespoons  all-purpose flour
       1    tablespoon  baking powder
       1                Egg -- beaten
       2          cups  buttermilk
   1 1/2          cups  cooking oil -- about

 Mix all dry ingredients; beat milk and egg together and combine with dry ingredients; batter should hold its shape when picked up on spoon.  If it is too soft, add more cornmeal.

 Drop by rounded tablespoonfuls into 350 degree fat and cook about 1 1/2 minutes; turn and cook on second side 1 minute.  Allow oil to heat a few seconds after removing a batch.

 Delicious freshly cooked and hot; however hush puppies freeze well.  When ready to serve frozen hush puppies; place on oven rack in heat until very hot and crisp.

Makes about 48 hush puppies 2" round.

HINTS ON FRYING:   Using a small diameter heavy saucepan allows using a minimum of oil; a 5 or 6 inch pan  with oil 1 1/2 inches deep and heated to 350 degrees will cook three hush puppies in about 2 1/2 minutes.  When batter consistency is correct and oil is at 350 degrees, hush puppies will become firm, round shapes almost as soon as they enter the hot oil.  If they are cooked in oil that is too hot, they will not cook in the center.
