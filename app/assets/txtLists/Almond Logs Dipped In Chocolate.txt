--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1           cup  butter -- softened
       7        ounces  almond paste
       1           cup  powdered sugar
       2                egg yolks
       1      teaspoon  almond extract
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
       2          cups  all-purpose flour
                        topping:
       1           cup  semisweet chocolate chips
       1    tablespoon  shortening
       1           cup  almonds -- finely chopped

Preheat oven to 350 degrees; line cookie sheets with parchment paper.  In a large mixer bowl, combine the butter and almond paste.  Beat on low speed, scraping the bowl often, for 1 to 2 minutes until well mixed.  Add the powdered sugar, egg yolks, almond extract and vanilla extract.  Beat on medium speed, scraping the bowl often, for 1 to 2 minutes until well mixed.  Reduce the speed to low. Continue beating, gradually adding the flour and scraping the bowl often, for 1 to 2 minutes until well mixed.  Place the dough in a pastry bag with a 1/2-inch opening.  Pipe onto the cookie sheets forming 2 1/2 to 3-inch logs.  Bake for 13 to 17 minutes, or until the edges are very lightly browned.  Cool completely on parchment paper.  In a 1-quart saucepan, melt the chocolate chips and shortening over low heat, stirring often, for 5 to 8 minutes until smooth. Remove the cooled cookies from the parchment paper and dip the ends or the tops in the chocolate and then in the almonds.  Place on waxed paper until set.  Penny Halsey (ATBN65B).
