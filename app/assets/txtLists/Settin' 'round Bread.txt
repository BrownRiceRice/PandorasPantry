     1/4           cup  water -- at 105 deg. f
     1/3           cup  turbinado sugar -- or reg sugar
       2     envelopes  dry yeast
     1/4           cup  butter
     1/4           cup  shortening
   5 1/2          cups  water
     1/2           cup  milk
       1         large  egg
       1           cup  nonfat dry milk
   5 1/2     teaspoons  salt
   1 1/2   tablespoons  honey
     1/8      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2           cup  rolled oats
     1/2           cup  cornmeal
     1/4           cup  bran
     1/4           cup  cracked wheat
     1/4           cup  buckwheat
     1/2           cup  soy flour
       1           cup  rye flour
   2 1/2          cups  whole-wheat flour
       3          cups  white flour
                        butter

Melt the shortening and the butter.  Let them cool a bit, so as not to kill the yeast when they are added to the dough.  If you want to scald the milk, do so, and also let it cool (it is common practice to scald milk before baking with it, though I never do.)

Dissolve the yeast and sugar in the 1/4 cup of lukewarm water.

Mix the cinnamon, oats, corn meal, bran, cracked wheat, buckwheat, soy flour, and rye flour.  Add the rest of the water, the milk, butter, shortening, egg, and honey, and mix well.  Stir in the dissolved yeast mixture.  Mix in the salt, and the whole wheat flour.

Stir in the white flour, about 1/2 cup at a time, until the mixture is stiff enough to knead.  You'll probably have about half of it left.

Remove the dough from the mixing bowl, onto a floured surface.  Knead the dough, adding more white flour as necessary to keep the dough workable. Knead the dough until it is smooth and elastic, about ten minutes.  It's okay if you end up using less than or more than the three cups of white flour; just use whatever it takes.

Put the dough back into a bowl that's been very lightly greased.  Let it rise, covered, in a still, warm place (around 85 deg. F is best, though room temperature will work) for 45 minutes, or until it has doubled in bulk.

Punch the dough down, divide in half, shape into loaves, and place each half into a loaf pan which has been very lightly greased.  Let rise again, for another 45 minutes, in a still, warm place, until the loaves have about doubled in bulk.

Preheat the oven to 350 deg. F as the bread finishes rising.  Bake the bread for 35-40 minutes, until it sounds hollow when tapped.  Remove from the loaf pans, and rub the top of the loaves with some butter to give them a nice, soft, chewy crust.
