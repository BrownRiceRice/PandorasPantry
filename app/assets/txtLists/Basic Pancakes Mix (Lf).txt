                        mix--
       4          cups  wholewheat flour
       4          cups  flour, all-purpose
       2          cups  wheat germ
       1           cup  milk -- nonfat dry
     1/3           cup  baking powder
       1      teaspoon  salt -- pancakes-
   1 1/2          cups  dry mix -- *
       1                eggs -- beaten well
   1 1/4          cups  milk, skim -- or water
       1    tablespoon  oil
                        nonstick cooking spray

  *Make your own nutritious, homemade pancake mix. Store the dry mix in an airtight container--add the wet ingredients when you are ready to prepare the pancakes.  Combine the mix with the egg, milk, and oil.  Do not overmix; the batter will be slightly lumpy.  Heat a TEFLON pan, or other pan spray with nonstick cooking spray, over medium heat. Pour about 1/4 cup of batter per pancake onto the heated pan. When the cakes are bubbly on top and brown on the bottom, flip and brown on the other side.
