                        -----1-1/2 lb loaf-----
     2/3           cup  plain lo-fat yogurt
     1/3           cup  milk
       1    tablespoon  butter or margarine
       1      teaspoon  salt
   2 3/4          cups  bread flour
     1/2           cup  cornmeal
       1    tablespoon  sugar
       2     teaspoons  bread machine yeast

Add ingredients to machine in order given by manufacturer, adding the yogurt with the milk. Basic/white bread cycle. Medium/normal color setting.

 Yogurt is the secret ingredient that gives the tang reminiscent of sourdough.

 NOTE: Yogurt varies in moisture content. If dough is too stiff or dry, add some milk. If too soft or slack, add some flour.
