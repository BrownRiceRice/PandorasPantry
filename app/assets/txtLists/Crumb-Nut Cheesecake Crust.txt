       5         ounce  pecans (approx.)
     3/4           cup  vanilla wafer crumbs
     1/4           cup  confectioners sugar
     1/4           cup  melted butter

Chop nuts very finely in food grinder or food processor (a salad shooter works great, put through twice.) Should have 1 cup of ground nuts. Cookies should also be chopped very finely.  Combine crumbs, chopped nuts and sugar, and mix thoroughly; drizzle with melted butter and mix lightly. Press onto bottom and 1 1/2 inches up side of springform pan. Note 1: Requires about 25 vanilla wafers to make 3/4 cups crumbs. Note 2: Any type of dry, unfilled, unfrosted cookies may be used for the crumbs. Chocolate snaps are good too.
