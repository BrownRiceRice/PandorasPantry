     1/3           cup  flour
       1         pound  boneless chicken breast
      16         ounce  tomato sauce
                        fresh pepper

Dice pepperoni into 1/4" cubes. Cook in frying pan over medium heat until mostly degreased. Remove from pan and set aside. Cut chicken into bite-sized pieces. Season flour and toss chicken pieces until coated. Brown in pepperoni fat (and olive oil, if needed). Set aside. Stir tomato sauce and remaining flour together in pan. Stir in chicken and pepperoni. Add 1/3-1/2 cup water to cover meat. Allow to simmer 30-45 minutes or until chicken is tender. Serve over a bed of pasta.
