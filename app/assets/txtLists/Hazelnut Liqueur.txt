--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  hazelnuts -- finely chopped
   1 1/2          cups  vodka
     1/3           cup  sugar
       3   tablespoons  water
       1      teaspoon  vanilla extract

In a glass bottle or jar, steep the chopped hazelnuts in the vodka for about 2 weeks in a cool, dark place, gently shaking the bottle every day. Gently pour the contents through a strainer or sieve, pressing hard on the nuts to release all the flavor. Follow this by 2 strainings through slightly dampened cheesecloth or large coffee filter; loosely cover the contents with plastic wrap, since the process may take several hours. In a very small saucepan, combine the sugar and water. Bring to a boil over moderate-high heat. Simmer, uncovered for 5 minutes. Let cool to room temperature. Stir in the vanilla.  Funnel into a glass bottle, the funnel in the sugar syrup. Cover tightly; shake to blend. Let mature at room temperature, or slightly cooler, for at least 3 weeks.   Homemade version of Frangelico.
