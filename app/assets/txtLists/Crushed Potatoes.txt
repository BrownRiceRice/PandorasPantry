       8                new potatoes -- medium
                        kosher salt
       1    tablespoon  olive oil
       1         small  onion -- minced
       2   tablespoons  parsley -- chopped
                        black pepper to taste

In a medium saucepan, cover potatoes with water.  Salt lightly and bring to a simmer.  Cook until just tender, 10 - 15 minutes. Drain. Preheat the broiler. Spray a baking sheet lightly with non-stick cooking spray. Place 1 potato on a clean kitchen towel and fold towel over the potato. Press down on the potato firmly with the palm of your hand, crushing the potato lightly.  Place the potato on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining potatoes. Brush the tops of the potatoes with oil. Broil until the tops are brown and crusty, 5 - 8 minutes. Sprinkle with onions, parsley, salt and pepper before serving. 179 cal 4g prot 2g fat 0 chlo per serving
