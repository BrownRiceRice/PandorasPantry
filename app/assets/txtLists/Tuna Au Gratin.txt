--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       2          cans  tuna (7 oz cans)
     2/3           cup  onion -- chopped
     1/4           cup  green pepper -- chopped
     1/4           cup  pimiento -- chopped
     2/3           cup  mayonnaise
     1/4           cup  bread crumbs, fine -- dry
     1/4           cup  parmesan cheese -- grated

Combine first 5 ingredients.  Spoon into small shallow baking dish. Sprinkle with bread crumbs and cheese. Bake in 350F oven 20 minutes or until thoroughly heated. Serves 4 I sometimes add one or two cups of COOKED elbow macaroni. I've used this Hellmann's Mayonnaise recipe card for 20 years or more. It is really dog-eared from frequent use.
