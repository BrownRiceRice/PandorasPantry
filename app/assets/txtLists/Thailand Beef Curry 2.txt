Make coconut milk by cracking shell of coconut with hammer.  Pry out meat with blunt knife.  Cut meat into 1/2" chunks.  Combine half the coconut meat and 1 1/2 cups of the hot water in blender.  When paste has formed, strain through cloth into a bowl or 4 cup measure.  Repeat with remaining coconut and water.  Stir in enough water to make 4 cups.

Bring to a boil being careful not to boil over.  When foaming ceases, turn to simmer.
