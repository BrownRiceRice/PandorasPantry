                        salt
       1                onion -- chopped
     1/2         pound  fresh mushrooms -- sliced
                        olive oil
       1                minced clove of garlic
                        fresh ground pepper (taste)
       6                eggs
     1/2         pound  feta cheese
     1/2           cup  grated parmesan
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh parsley
       1      teaspoon  oregano
     1/4      teaspoon  dried rosemary (optional)
     1/4         pound  butter
       1         pound  phyllo dough

If using fresh spinach, wash the spinach and remove the rough stems.  Place in large bowl and sprinkle heavily with salt.  Rub the salt into the leaves by takin them up, a bunch at a time, and rubbing them between your hands;  the volume of spinach will decrease drastically as you do. Tear the spinach up as you do this. Rinse the salt off thoroughly and dry the spinach, squeezing it in bunches in a towel.  (If using frozen spinach, just let it thaw and squeeze out the excess moisture.) Saute the onion and mushrooms in a little olive oil and butter with the garlic and salt and pepper to taste. When both onions and mushrooms are tender remove from heat. Beat the eggs in a large bowl and crumble in the feta, add the parmesan, then the spinach, onions, mushrooms, stir in the parsley, organo, rosemary, some freshly ground pepper, and a little salt (remembering the feta is very salty)

Spray 1 phyllo sheet with nonstick cooking spray; top with another sheet and spray it. Line the baking pan with these 2 sheets, letting the edges hang over the sides. Spread the spinach mixture over the phyllo. Cover the filling with the more sheets(about 4), spraying each sheet and tucking them into the pan. Fold in the outside sheets. Bake until golden, 30-35 minutes.
