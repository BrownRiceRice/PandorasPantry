--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  dried apricots
       1           cup  flour
       2     teaspoons  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  sugar
     3/4           cup  milk
       1                egg -- slightly beaten
       1    tablespoon  orange peel -- grated
       1    tablespoon  vegetable oil
     1/2           cup  whole-grain wheat flour
       1           cup  walnuts -- coarsely chopped

Instructions: ------------- Place the apricots on a chopping block.  Sprinkle 1 T flour over them. Dip a knife into the flour and chop the apricots finely.  Flour the knife often to keep the cut up fruit from sticking together.  Sift the remaining flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and sugar into a large bowl. Combine the milk, egg, orange peel, and oil.  Stir the flour mixture and the whole wheat flour.  Fold in the cut up apricots, any flour left on the cutting block and the walnuts.  Pour into a well greased, floured baking unit.  Cover and place on a rack in the slow cooker, but prop the lid open a fraction with a toothpick or a twist of foil to let excess steam escape.  Cook on High for 4 to 6 hours.  Cool on a rack for 10 minutes.  Serve warm or cold. Now before you all ask what a baking unit is (I wondered as I sat and typed this in), I looked it up in the front of the bread section. She says that some manufacturers are making units for slow cookers, but if you don't have one, a 2 pound coffee can works.  Pyrex muffin cups also work. Also 1, 1 1/2 and 2 quart molds work.

Do not lift the lid while baking this bread.
