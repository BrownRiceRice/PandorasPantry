       2          cups  unbleached flour
       2          cups  whole wheat flour
       1       package  rapid rise yeast -- 1/4 oz
       1    tablespoon  sugar
       1      teaspoon  salt
                        warm water
       2     teaspoons  olive oil
       1         large  egg white

In a large bowl, add first 5 ingredients (dry ingredients) and mix together.  Add warm water gradually and mix until a soft dough is formed.  (amount of water is not specified) Add the olive oil; mix well and turn out on a floured board and knead for 6 minutes.  Add flour only if necessary.   Divide dough into 6 equal parts; roll out with hands to make 6 ropes.  Form these into 2 braids (using 3 ropes for each).  Place on aluminum foil in pan; make some diagonal cuts.  Brush with egg white wash and sprinkle with sesame seeds.  Let rise for one hour or more.   Bake on middle rack of 400 degree oven for 15-20 minutes. Cool on a wire rack.
