       2                apples
     1/3           cup  walnuts (chopped)
     1/4      teaspoon  lemon juice
     1/4           cup  margarine
     1/3         pound  phyllo leaves
                        bread crumbs

Peel, core and chop apples.  Combine apples, walnuts and lemon juice in mixing bowl;  fold to mix.  Melt margarine. Place 2 phyllo leaves on a lightly dampened, lightly bread-crumbed cloth. Brush leaves lightly with melted margarine.  Lay a second leaf on top of each leaf. Brush each layer lightly with melted margarine. Repeat using all the leaves. Place apple filling 2 inch in from long edges.  Fold long edges in over the filling. Fold over the ends.  Roll up dough, jelly-roll fashion. Score top into 10 pieces with a sharp knife or scissors and place on greased cookie sheet. Bake at 350F for 25 minutes, or until lightly browned. 1 piece = 1/2 bread, 1 fat    calories = 108
