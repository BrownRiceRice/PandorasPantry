       3    tablespoon  unflavored gelatin
     1/2           cup  cold water
       3                eggs -- separated
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  light cream
   1 1/2         pound  cream cheese -- softened
       1      teaspoon  vanilla
       1           cup  heavy cream
       2      teaspoon  coffee liquer
       2    tablespoon  instant coffee -- dissolved in
       3    tablespoon  hot water

Use a 10 inch springform pan. CRUST: In a medium-sided bowl, combine the butter cookie crumbs, sugar and butter. Blend well with fingers, fork or pastry blender. Press or pat the mixture onto the bottom and sides of a well-buttered springform pan. Chill in the freezer or fridge for about 30 minutes. FILLING: Soften the gelatin in the cold water. In a small saucepan, combine the egg yolks and sugar and gradually stir in the light cream. cook the mixture over medium heat, stirring, until it coats a metal spoon. Remove from the heat and stir in the softened gelatin. Beat the cream cheese until very smooth and creamy, then add the vanilla and continue to beat until very smooth and creamy. Add the gelatin mixture to the cheese mixture and beat until smooth. Chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes or until the mixture is set. In separate small mixing bowls, whip the heavy cream and beat the egg whites until stiff, then fold both into the cream cheese mixture. In a small saucepan, heat the instant coffee dissolved in water, and the coffee liqueur, stirring until smooth. Add the coffee mixture to the cheese mixture and beat until very smooth and creamy. Pour into the chilled springform pan and refrigerate for 3 hours, or until cake is set and firm. Carefully remove the sides of the springform pan, transfer cake to a serving dish, and serve.
