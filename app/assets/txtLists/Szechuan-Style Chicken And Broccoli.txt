       2                chicken breasts* -- split; boned and ski
     1/3           cup  pace picante sauce
      20   milliliters  garlic -- minced
       2   tablespoons  soy sauce
       1    tablespoon  ginger -- shredded
       1    tablespoon  water
       1    tablespoon  cornstarch
   1 1/2          cups  broccoli flowerets
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
       1                red pepper
       3   tablespoons  vegetable oil
       1                onion -- thin wedges

(We use much less meat than this; either 1 whole chicken breast or 1/2 lb. ground turkey or ground chicken.) Cut chicken into 1-inch cubes. Combine picante sauce, soy sauce, water, cornstarch and sugar in small bowl; set aside. Heat 2 T. of the oil in wok or large skillet over medium high heat. Add chicken and stir-fry 3 to 4 minutes or until cooked through. Remove with slotted spoon. Add remaining oil onion, garlic and ginger to skillet; stir-fry 30 seconds. Add broccoli and peppers; stir-fry 3 minutes or until vegetables are crisp-tender. Add chicken and picante sauce mixture; stir-fry about 1 minute or until sauce thickens.

 I don't cook the meat and vegetables separately. It takes a little longer, but there are less dishes to wash and you only need 2 T. oil. I cook the garlic and ginger for a few seconds before throwing the meat in. I cook the meat for 20 or 30 seconds, and then throw in the vegetables one at a one at a time, stirring 5 or 6 seconds between each addition. I cook everything for 5 or 6 minutes, stirring, of course. Then I pull everything up on the sides of the wok and pour the sauce in the center, stirring the sauce until thickened. Then I stir everything together for a minute or two. It's done. I use high on my stove when cooking with my wok on a fire-ring. This is easy and delicious and lower in sodium than many of the bottled sauces. This recipe is from the Pace Picante Sauce 40th Anniversary Recipe Collection.
