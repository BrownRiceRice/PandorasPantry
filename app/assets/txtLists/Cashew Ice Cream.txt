  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1      Teaspoon  Agar -- granules
                        Or
       2   Tablespoons  Agar -- flakes
   2 1/2          Cups  Water
     3/4           Cup  Cashew Butter
     1/4           Cup  Honey
       1      Teaspoon  Vanilla
       1    Tablespoon  Lemon Juice

Put the agar and water in a saucepan and heat until agar granules are dissolved. Agar flakes may require simmering several minutes before they are ready; follow the directions on the jar. When agar water is ready, remove from the heat and cool to lukewarm. Put agar water and remaining ingredients into a blender and whip for one minute. Pour the mixture into an ice cream freezer. Following the freezer instructions, freeze until firm. Store ice cream in the refrigerator freezer until ready to serve.

VARIATIONS: Omit one cup of water and add one cup of fruit pulp just before pouring into the freezer. Bananas, strawberries, or peaches make excellent fruit-flavored ice creams. For carob ice cream, add 1/4 cup carob flour. Add 1/2 cup chopped walnuts or pecans for a delicious flavor and a crunchy texture. Substitute any kind of nut or seed butter for cashew butter.
