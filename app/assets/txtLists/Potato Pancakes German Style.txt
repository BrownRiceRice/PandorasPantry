*    Potatoes are grated on medium grater.  2 1/2 Cups Approx. 

Grate raw potatoes into water to which lemon juice has been added. Place potatoes in a strainer or cheese cloth and drain off liquid. Drain well. Beat raw and cooked potatoes with egg, milk, and salt to form a batter. Using 3 T oil for each batch, drop batter for 3 or 4 pancakes at a time in hot oil in a large frypan.  When firm on the bottom side, loosen edges and turn.  Brown on other side.  Remove, drain on paper towel, and keep warm. Continue until all batter is used. Serve immediately. NOTE: If potato cakes are served with meat, sprinkle with salt. Sprinkle with sugar if served with applesauce.
