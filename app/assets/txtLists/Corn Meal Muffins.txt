       1           cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
       4      teaspoon  baking powder
       2    tablespoon  granulated sugar
       1      teaspoon  salt
       1           cup  yellow cornmeal
       2         large  eggs
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil

Grease 12 2 1/2-inch muffin cups.  Heat oven to 425 degrees F.

 Sift flour, baking powder, sugar and salt into medium-sized bowl.  Add cornmeal and stir to mix well.

 In small bowl, beat eggs with fork.  Add milk and oil.  Add all at once to dry ingredients.

 Stir mixture only until dry ingredients are moistened.  Batter will be lumpy.

 Bake 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden brown.  Remove and serve hot with butter, bacon and eggs.
