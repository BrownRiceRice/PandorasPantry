       2          cups  bacon drippings (for roux)
       6          cups  plain flour
       7          cups  onion, chopped
       1           cup  bell pepper, chopped
       3          cups  green onions, chopped
       1           cup  celery, chopped
       3          cups  parsley, chopped
     1/4           cup  garlic, chopped
                        bacon drippins/brown chicken
      20        pounds  baking hens (see directions)
                        water
       1         pound  mushrooms, sliced
      16          cups  tomato sauce
       8          cups  chablis wine
   1 1/2         pints  stuffed olives
       6   tablespoons  lea & perrins
       8   tablespoons  Louisiana hot sauce
       1      teaspoon  dried mint, crushed
       6   tablespoons  salt

The bacon drippings are for browning the chicken. The 20 lbs of chicken should be cut up in 2-inch-long pieces. Justin likes more wine in this sauce than some peoples.  If you don't wish to use all 8 Cups of Chablis in the sauce, feel free to drink what the sauce don't take. Make sure you taste your sauce as you add the wine.  Me, I likes it.  My wife, she don't. Make a roux.  (see the recipe for Justin Wilson's roux, also posted here).  Add onions, bell pepper, green onions, and celery and saute until onions are tender and clear.  Add parsley and garlic and saute. Brown off chicken while roux is being made.  After onions, etc. are tender, add water to bring roux to a smooth paste.  Add all other ingredients and enough water to cover well.  Bring to a boil, and then cut heat.  Cook for about 4 to 6 hours. Serve over spaghetti.  This is for a party and will serve 20 to 40 people.  You can freeze what you don't eat. From Justin Wilson's "Outdoor Cooking With Inside Help"
