--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  active starter
     1/2           cup  pancake mix
       1         large  egg
       1    tablespoon  cooking oil
     1/2           cup  milk
     1/2      teaspoon  soda

Mix all ingredients well.  Be careful not to over mix. Small lumps are ok. Lightly grease a hot cast iron griddle. Drop onto griddle with a large spoon while the batter is still rising.
