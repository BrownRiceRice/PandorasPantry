   1 1/2          cups  all-purpose flour -- flour
       1           cup  sugar
   1 1/2     teaspoons  salt

       2          cups  pecan halves -- or Brazil nuts
       1         pound  dates -- pitted
       8        ounces  maraschino cherries -- drained

Sift flour with sugar, salt and baking powder into a large bowl.  Add nuts, dates and cherries and stir so that all nuts and fruits are covered with flour mixture.

In another bowl beat bananas until mashed.  Add eggs and continue beating until well blended and mixture is light and fluffy.  Fold into flour mixture.

Pour into 8x5x2 #/4 inch loaf pan which has been lined with brown paper and greased well. (Pan will be full, but since the cake dose not rise much.  It will bake satisfactorily.)  Bake in 300 degree over for 1 3/4 to 2 hours or until cake springs back when center is touched lightly with the finger.  cool in pan on rack 15 minutes.

Remove cake from pan and pull off brown paper.  cool on rack. Frost with confectioner's sugar frosting. Decorate top as desired.

Wrap cake in transparent wrap or aluminum foil and store in cool place.  to serve, slice in thin slices with a sharp knife.  In any event, let cake stand overnight before cutting.

Makes one 3 1/2 pound fruit cake.
