       1       package  holly farms chicken franks
       1    tablespoon  vegetable oil
     2/3           cup  apple jelly
       1           cup  hot chili sauce
       2   tablespoons  cider vinegar
       2   tablespoons  worcestershire sauce
       2                green-skinned apples -- unpeeled and cut in
                        -- 1" chunks
                        toothpicks

Cut each frankfurter into 4 pieces. Heat the oil in a skillet and saute the frankfurters for about 4 minutes, turning to cook each side evenly. In a saucepan or chafing dish, combine the jelly, chili sauce, vinegar and worcestershire sauce. Heat gently, stirring often, until hot and the jelly is melted and smooth. At serving time, add the cooked frankfurters and the apple pieces to the sauce. Heat about 5 minutes until the apples and frankfurters are thoroughly warmed. Serve hot with toothpicks for spearing the frankfurters and apples. Yield: 8 - 10 hors d'oeuvre servings.
