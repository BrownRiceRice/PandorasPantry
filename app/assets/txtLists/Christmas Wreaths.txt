--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  light corn syrup
       3   tablespoons  sugar
       3   tablespoons  butter
                        green food coloring
   2 1/4          cups  corn flakes
                        red cinnamon candies
                        shredded coconut

Combine corn syrup, sugar and butter in a saucepan.  Bring to a boil over medium heat.  Stir constantly.  Continue boiling for 5 minutes, stirring constantly.  Remove from heat and add a few drops of food coloring at a time until the mixture is about the color green that you want.  Remember, you are trying to simulate the color of a Christmas evergreen wreath.

Now stir the warm syrup into the dry corn flakes.  Stir until well combined.  Now drop by the teaspoons onto waxed paper.  You want to make little round wreaths.  They can be as small as an inch or you can use all the mixture and make one huge wreath to use as a centerpiece-dessert.

Decorate you wreaths with cinnamon candies to look life ornaments or holly berries. You also may sprinkle on shredded coconut to look life snowy branches.  Let cool to harden.

Yield":  This will depend on what size wreaths you make.  You might get one big one or lots of tiny ones.
