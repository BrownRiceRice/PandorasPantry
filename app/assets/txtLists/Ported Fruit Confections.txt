Grind raisins, peaches and figs together.

Finely chop walnuts.

Combine with fruits, port and sugar.  Mix well and let stand 1 hour.

Shape into 1" balls.

Melt chocolate very slowly over warm, not hot, water.  When chocolate is completely melted, dip half the balls 1 at a time in chocolate, using 2 forks.

Allow excess chocolate to drip back, then place candies on waxed paper until chocolate is set.

Roll remaining balls in confectioners sugar.
