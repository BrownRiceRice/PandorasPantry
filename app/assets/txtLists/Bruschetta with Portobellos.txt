      10        ounces  portabella mushrooms
     1/4           cup  olive oil
       1      teaspoon  garlic -- minced
       1          loaf  Italian bread -- cut diagonally in 12

Preheat outdoor grill, or broiler until hot. Trim portabella stems, if attached, slice mushrooms. In a small bowl, combine olive oil and garlic, brush on both sides of mushroom slices and the bread.

In a small bowl, stir together tomatoes, capers and Italian seasoning. To assemble: Place one slice goat cheese on each slice of toasted bread. Top with grilled portobellos and tomato-caper mixture, dividing evenly.
