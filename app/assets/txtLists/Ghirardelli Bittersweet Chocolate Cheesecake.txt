   2 1/2           cup  sugar
      43         ounce  cream cheese(yes -- 43!)
       5                eggs
      32         ounce  ghirardelli bittersweet
                        chocolate(not semisweet!)
      20         ounce  sour cream
       1    tablespoon  vanilla
       2    tablespoon  bailey's irish cream
       2    tablespoon  ghirardelli ground chocolate
                        if unavailable -- use cocoa

CRUST: Mix in food processor. Press into 13 inch springform pan. Set aside. CHEESECAKE: Melt chocolate in double boiler, stirring frequently. Set aside. Beat cream cheese with hand mixer until smooth. Gradually add sugar. Beat until smooth. Add one egg at a time, beating after each egg. Fold in sour cream, melted chocolate, ground chocolate, vanilla and Bailey's. Stir until even consistency. Pour into crust. Bake at 350 F until set, approximately 2 hours for 13". chill thoroughly. Serves 46 This is ungodly rich. Serve in very small wedges. even heavy eaters can't eat much at once, and I have seen a lot of this get thrown away because the person couldn't finish. Don't substitute semi-=sweet chocolate or milk chocolate for the bittersweet.
