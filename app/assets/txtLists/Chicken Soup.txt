--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       2         whole  chickens -- cut up
       2        medium  onions -- chopped
       2          cups  celery -- sliced
       4          cups  carrots -- sliced
       2         quart  tomatoes -- chopped
       1  small   head  cabbage -- sheredded
       7                potatoes -- peeled and chopped
       4                chicken bouillon cubes
       1                bay leaf
                        salt and pepper -- to taste
       1      teaspoon  marjoram
       2     teaspoons  basil
       1      teaspoon  thyme
       2   tablespoons  parsley -- chopped
   1 1/2        pounds  spaghetti -- broken into pieces

Wash chicken pieces and place in large stockpot. Cover with water and bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer until chicken falls off the bones (approximately 2-3 hours). Remove chicken with slotted spoon and let cool. When cool enough to handle, remove bones and skin and cut all chicken up in small pieces, being careful not to leave any bones. Add chicken to stock left in pan and refrigerate overnight. When you remove pot from refrigerator, skim off the grease from the top of the stock (the chicken will be very moist from having remained in the stock overnight). Return pot to heat and slowly bring to boil. Add onions, celery, carrots, tomatoes, cabbage and potatoes.  Add bouillon, bay leaf, salt and pepper, marjoram, basil, thyme and parsley and simmer until vegetables are done to your liking. 

Then add broken pieces of spaghetti and cook until tender. The soup will be very thick, almost stew-like. It freezes well.
