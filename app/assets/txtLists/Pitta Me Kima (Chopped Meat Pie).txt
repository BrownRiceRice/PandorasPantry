                        spalding
       2        pounds  chopped meat
     1/2           cup  butter
       2                onions -- chopped
   1 1/4        pounds  tomatoes, strained -- peeled or
       1    tablespoon  tomato paste diluted with:
       1           cup  water
       1         piece  stick cinnamon
       1    tablespoon  parsley -- chopped
                        salt & pepper to taste
       2        slices  toast
       2          cups  milk
       1           cup  parmesan cheese -- grated
       5                eggs -- lightly beaten
     3/4         pound  phyllo

Brown meat, half the butter, and onions in lge. pot, stirring with a wooden spoon to break up meat. Add tomatoes (or diluted tomato paste) cinnamon, parsley, salt & pepper. Simmer until all liquid is absorbed (abt. 30 min.).  In the meantime, soak toast in milk, then mash with fork.

 Remove cinnamon stick and add milk-toast mixture to the meat; remove from the heat.  Add cheese and eggs, and mix well.

 Melt remaining butter; butter a pan abt. 2 inches smaller than the phyllo.  Put 7 to 8 phyllo sheets, buttering each before addint it, into the pan, letting phyllo extend on all sides. Pour in meat mixture and spread it ivenly.  Fold overlapping phyllo back onto meat. Butter these well.  Carefully cut remaining sheets of phyllo to fit the top of the pan. Brush each with butter and lay on the filling to make the top of the pitta. Pour on any remaining butter and sprinkle the top very lightly with a little water (to keep phyllo from rising too high). Bake in preheated 350 F. oven for 30 to 40 min. Cool abt. 30 min, and cut into squares to serve.

 NOTE:  It is easier to cut this if you score it lightly before baking.
