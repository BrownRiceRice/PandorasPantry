       5                eggs -- room temperature
       1           cup  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  instant coffee powder
       3   tablespoons  water -- boiling
       1      teaspoon  vanilla
       1           cup  all purpose flour -- sifted
       1      teaspoon  baking powder
       2          cups  whipping cream
       2   tablespoons  sugar
     1/4           cup  coffee -- very strong cold
       2   tablespoons  coffee liqueur
                        walnut; chopped -- toasted
                        chocolate coffee beans

Preheat oven to 350:. Separate eggs. Combine egg yolks and 1 cup sugar in large bowl and beat until thick and lemon colored, about 5 minutes. Dissolve coffee powder in boiling water. Blend in vanilla and dissolved coffee powder. Combine flour and baking powder and blend into batter. Beat egg whites until stiff. Fold into batter. Turn into ungreased 10" tube pan. Bake 30 minutes. Invert onto rack and let stand until completely cool. For frosting: Whip cream with 2 tablespoons sugar until soft peaks form. Add coffee and liqueur and beat until stiff. Slice cake crosswise into thirds. Use about 1/3 of cream frosting to fill layers and remainder to frost entire cake (save some frosting and pipe rosettes over top for garnish, if desired). Chill until whipped cream is slightly firm. Press nuts onto sides of cake and arrange coffee beans atop rosettes, if desired. Chill 4 hours before serving.
