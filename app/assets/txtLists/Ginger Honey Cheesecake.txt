                        -----crust-----
       1           cup  fine graham cracker crumbs
                        (about 8 full crackers)
       1    tablespoon  sugar
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter -- cold
                        cut into 1/4 inch pieces
                        -----filling-----
       1         pound  cream cheese -- at room temp.
     1/2           cup  honey
     1/2           cup  sugar
       2         large  eggs -- at room temp.
   1 1/4           cup  sour cream
       1    tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
   1 1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
     2/3           cup  golden raisins
                        finely minced
       1    tablespoon  candied ginger -- or more
                        (to taste) finely minced

Here's the recipe you wanted from Ken Haedrich's Home For the Holidays cookbook. Butter the sides only of an 8-in. springform pan. Make the crust by mixing the cracker crumbs and 1 T. sugar in a bowl. Add the butter and rub it in until all of the crumbs are dampened by the fat. Distribute the crumbs loosely but evenly in the pan and press them in ; pushing them slightly up the sides. Cover and chill while you make the filling; preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Using an electric mixer, cream the cream cheese, honey, and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then add the remaining ingredients and continue to beat until evenly blended; use the greater amount of ginger if you want a pronounced ginger flavor, the lesser amount for a subtle effect. Scrape the filling into the pan and bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes. Cool the cake thoroughly on a rack--it will take several hours--then cover, still in the pan, and refrigerate for 12 hours before unmolding and slicing.

 Note: Ken Haedrich writes, "I have played around some with baking cheesecakes in a water bath, curious to see if it made any difference in the final cake. It seems to improve the texture a little bit, making it creamier. And I'm not sure if this is just a coincidence, but my water bath cakes don't split on top after they come out of the oven, perhaps Formatted by Elaine Radis
