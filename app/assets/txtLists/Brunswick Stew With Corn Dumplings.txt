Soak lima beans overnight in cold water then drain.  Combine first 6 ingredients in small piece of cheesecloth and secure with a string.  Add to an 8-quart pot with the stock and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat.  Add hen, giblets, and 1 chopped onion. Simmer, covered, until the chicken is tender, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Chill overnight if desired.  Skim fat from surface of stock.  Remove chicken; discard skin and bones and cut meat into bite-size pieces.  Set aside. Cook bacon until crisp in medium skillet over medium heat.  Remove with slotted spoon to paper towel and drain well.  Add to stock.  Pour off all but 2 tblsp  fat and place skillet over high heat.  Add remaining onion and saute quickly until browned.  Add to stock along with potatoes, tomatoes, lima beans, tomato paste, red pepper, salt, and pepper, and stir to combine.  Cover partially and simmer until beans are tender, about 40-60 minutes.  (Stew can be prepared several days ahead to this point and refrigerated.) Stir in reserved chicken, okra, and corn.  Bring stew to simmer, then drop dumpling batter in by tablespoonfuls.  Cover pot securely and simmer until dumplings are puffed and a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, about 15 minutes.  Turn into soup tureen to serve or spoon dumplings into heated bowls and ladle soup over. Corn Dumplings:  Combine flour, cornmeal, baking powder, salt, and sugar in medium bowl and mix well.  Cut in butter using a pastry blender or two knives until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Stir in corn using fork, then add milk and stir just until moistened; -do not overmix-.  Add to stew and cook as directed.
