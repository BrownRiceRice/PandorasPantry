     1/3           cup  granulated sugar
     1/3           cup  packed light brown sugar

Heat oven to 350 F. Remove wrappers from chocolate pieces.


 In large bowl beat shortening and peanut butter until well blended. Add 1/3 cup granulated sugar; beat until light and fluffy. Add egg, milk and vanilla, beat well. Stir together flour, baking soda and salt; gradually add to peanut butter mixture. Shape dough into 1-inch balls. Roll in granulated sugar; place on ungreased cookie sheet.

Bake 8 to 10 minutes or until lightly browned. Immediately place chocolate piece on top of each cookie, pressing down so cookie cracks around the edges. Remove from cookie sheet to wire rack. Cool completely.
