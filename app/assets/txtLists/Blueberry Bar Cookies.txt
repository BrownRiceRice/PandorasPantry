       1       Package  Blueberry Muffin Mix -- wild
       1           Cup  Oats -- quick cooking
     1/3           Cup  Brown Sugar

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Wash blueberries and set aside to drain.

In large bowl combine dry muffin mix, oats and sugar; cut in butter.

Reserve about 1 1/2 cups of this crumb mixture; press the rest on the bottom of a greased 8" square pan.

Gently fold drained blueberries in jam or preserves.  Spoon over crumb mixture in pan; spread evenly.

Sprinkle the rest of crumbs and pat them evenly onto the berry mixture.

Bake at 375 degrees for 20 - 25 minutes, until golden brown.

Cool completely then cut into bars.
