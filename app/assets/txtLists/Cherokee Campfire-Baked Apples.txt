     1/4           Cup  Pecans -- Chopped

       4                Apples
       4      Teaspoon  Butter

In a small bowl, combine brown sugar, pecans, currants and spice.  

Core apples from the top, making a large enough hole in the center of apple for   filling but not cutting the skin at the bottom.  

Place 1 teaspoon butter in each apple, followed by a tablespoon of the filling.
