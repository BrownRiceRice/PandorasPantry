(Don't be alarmed if it looks curdled. 6. Mix in the marmalade or jam on low speed. 7. Mix in half the FLOUR mixture on low speed and beat just until it is incorporated. 8. Add the BUTTERMILK and mix. 9. Add the rest of the FLOUR and beat just until smooth. 10. Spread the batter in the pan, using a spatula to help get an even layer. 11. Sprinkle the topping over the cake and pat gently into the batter with your fingertips. 12. Bake 40 to 45 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean and the cake starts to pull away from the sides of the pan. 13. Cool the cake in the pan on a rack for 20 to 30 minutes before serving, or, wait until it reaches room temperature.
