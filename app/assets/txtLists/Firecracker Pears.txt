--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       3          cups  cranberry juice
       1           cup  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  cinnamon
       1    tablespoon  lemon juice
       8                Firm -- ripe pears, pared,
                        -- stems on

 Combine first 4 ingredients in large, deep saucepan and bring to boil stirring until sugar is dissolved.

 Set pears into boiling syrup and cook covered 8 to 10 minutes, turning fruit occasionally so it is cooked evenly.

 When fruit is just barely tender, remove from syrup with slotted spoon and transfer to serving dish or individual dishes.

 Boil syrup rapidly, uncovered, until reduced to 1 cup.

 Pour hot syrup over pears.

 Serve at room temperature.

SERVING SUGGESTIONS:  Allow pears to cool.  Put scoop of softened vanilla ice cream in dessert bowls.  Set pears on ice cream.  Pour warm syrup over pears.  Whipped cream can be used instead of ice cream.  Tuck mint leaf into whipped cream for garnish.
