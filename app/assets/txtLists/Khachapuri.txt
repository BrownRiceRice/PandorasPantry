--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1       package  yeast -- dry
       1      teaspoon  sugar
     1/4           cup  water -- warm (110)
     3/4           cup  milk -- room temp
       2    tablespoon  sugar
     1/2           cup  butter -- melted
       1      teaspoon  salt
   3 1/2           cup  flour (a/p or bread)
                        filling:
       8         ounce  muenster cheese
       8         ounce  jarlsberg or swiss
       8         ounce  cheddar -- white
       2                eggs -- beat slightly
       2    tablespoon  parsley -- chopped
     1/4      teaspoon  pepper -- white

Dissolve yeast and 1 tsp sugar in 1/4 cup water and let stand 5-10 minutes to proof until foamy. Add milk, 2 tbs sugar, butter, salt, and enough flour to make a soft dough. Place in greased bowl and turn to coat all sides. Cover and let rise until double in bulk. Shred cheeses, combine all filling ingredients and refrigerate. Grease a 9"  springform pan very well. Punch down dough, shape into a ball, and roll to a 20" circle. Ease dough into pan (fold in half to lift and unfold in pan) letting excess hang over the edge. Mound cheese filling onto dough in pan and bring dough up over the filling, folding to make 8-12 evenly spaced pleats. Twist and pinch ends together to make a rough knob. Cover with a buttered 12" square of waxed paper and let rise until double in bulk. Brush loaf with glaze of 1 egg white + 1 tbs water (or use marg). Bake 40-50 min. @ 375 Or until deep golden brown. Remove bread from pan, place directly on oven rack, and bake for an additional 5 minutes to brown bottom crust. Cool on rack for 45 minutes before cutting into wedges. * Served with soup or salad, this is a full meal!!! Can substitute 4 oz muenster and 4 oz swiss for 8 oz cheddar.
