--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1 1/2        pounds  fresh bay scallops (2 c.)
     1/3           cup  chopped onion
     2/3           cup  fresh lime juice
     1/4           cup  tomato juice
       1                tomato -- skinned/chopped
     1/4           cup  olive oil
     1/3           cup  green pepper*
     1/8      teaspoon  tabasco sauce -- or to taste
       1                garlic clove -- fine chopped
       1    tablespoon  parsley -- fine chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme
       1          dash  salt and ground pepper

*Seed and finely dice the green pepper. Rinse scallops and pat dry. Place in a bowl with remaining ingredients, cover, and allow to stand in refrigerator several hours or overnight. The lime juice does all the "cooking" that is necessary. Serve in scallop shells.
