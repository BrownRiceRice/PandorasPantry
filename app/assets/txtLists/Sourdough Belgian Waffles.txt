--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1 3/4          cups  flour -- sifted
       2     teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
       2   tablespoons  sugar
       3                eggs; separated
       1           cup  sourdough starter
     3/4           cup  milk
       6   tablespoons  butter -- melted

Sift flour with baking powder, salt and sugar.  Beat egg yolks, add butter, starter and milk.  Stir into flour mixture. Beat egg whites till stiff peaks form and then fold into batter. Spoon into preheated Belgian waffle iron, either well buttered or teflon (I oil my teflon!) Bake about 5 minutes or until beautifully golden brown! Let me know if you try these. I guarantee you'll never make another waffle recipe again! There are NO calories in these...it's all the good stuff you put on top!!!<ggg> Love ya...
