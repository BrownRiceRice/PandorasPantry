       2          cups  chicken stock
     1/2           cup  soy sauce
       3   tablespoons  sherry wine (optional)
     1/3           cup  fresh ginger -- thinly shredded or
                        -- 1/2 tsp. dry
                        -- powdered ginger
       2        cloves  garlic -- crushed, or 1/2
                        -- tsp. garlic puree

       3                fresh california bartlett pears -- sliced
       1           cup  green onions -- sliced
       2         large  bell peppers -- sliced

Put the roast in a deep roasting pan with a cover.

Pour stock, soy sauce, wine, ginger, garlic and brown sugar over.

Cover and bake in a 350 degree oven basting frequently until roast is done (about 1 1/2 to 2 hours).

Remove pork to a platter and keep warm.

Thicken pan liquid with a little cornstarch mixed with cold water and poach sliced pears, sliced onions and sliced peppers in sauce until just heated through.

Arrange fruit and vegetables around thin sliced meat.

Serve hot rice with this pork dish, mold the rice in ramekins, and turn out as they do in oriental restaurants. It's a nice authentic touch to this pork and vegetable dish.
