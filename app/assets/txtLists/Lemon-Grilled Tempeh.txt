  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  freshly squeezed lemon juice
     1/8           cup  olive oil
     1/4      teaspoon  thyme
     1/8      teaspoon  black pepper
      16        ounces  tempeh
       1         large  onion -- sliced into rings
       4                whole  wheat rolls

Preheat the oven to 400F. In a small bowl, combine the lemon juice, olive oil, thyme, and black pepper for a marinade; set aside. Cut the tempeh into pieces. Place the tempeh pieces in a steamer or metal sieve over boiling water and steam for 15 minutes.

In a 2-quart casserole dish, combine the tempeh and the onions; pour the marinade over them. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours.

Bake the tempeh, onions, and marinade, covered, for 30 minutes; or cook the tempeh and onions over a grill until heated through, basting with the marinade.

Place the tempeh and onions on the rolls. Garnish with lettuce and sliced tomatoes.
