--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1 1/2         pound  ground beef
       4         ounce  cheddar cheese -- grated
       1                onion -- chopped
       4         ounce  mozzarella cheese -- grated
      14         ounce  pizza sauce
      14         ounce  spaghetti sauce
       6         ounce  pepperoni -- sliced
      12         ounce  noodles
                        mushrooms
                        green peppers

Brown meat and onion. Drain grease. Add sauces. Simmer. Boil noodles till al dente; drain. You do not want the noodles to be soft. In crock pot, put a layer of sauce, noodles, meat/sauce mixture, cheeses, pepperoni and as much mushrooms and green peppers as desired. Original recipe I had said to repeat layers one more time, but I repeated layers a few times more. Cook on high for 30 minutes and then on low for 1 hour ( I cooked on low for 2 hours), or until cheese melts. Can be made in a deep casserole dish in the oven at 350:F until cheese melts.
