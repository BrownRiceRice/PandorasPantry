       2          cups  cranberries; fresh or frozen
       1           cup  milk
       1                egg; lg, slightly beaten
     1/4           cup  butter; melted
       1      teaspoon  orange peel; grated
       2          cups  unbleached flour
       1           cup  sugar
       1      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
   1 1/2          cups  cheddar; md, shredded
     1/2           cup  walnuts; coarsely chopped

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. then grease a 9 X 5-inch loaf pan; set aside.  Cut the cranberries in half and set aside in a small bowl. In a medium bowl, combine the milk, egg, butter, and orange peel and set aside. Sift the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt into a large bowl.  Add the halved cranberries, cheese and nuts.  Toss with a fork to distribute.  Add the milk mixture all at once and stir the flour mixture until just moistened.  Turn into the prepared loaf pan and bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes in the preheated oven or until a wooden pick inserted in the center comes out clean.  Cool in the pan on a rack for 10 minutes, then remove from the pan.  Cool to room temperature on the wire rack before slicing.
