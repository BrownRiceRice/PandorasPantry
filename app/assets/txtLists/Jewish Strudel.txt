--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       2          cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2          pint  sour cream
     1/2         pound  butter -- * see note
                        pineapple jam -- or one of choice
                        apricot jam -- or one of choice
                        coconut flakes
                        chopped nuts
                        Maraschino cherries -- chopped
                        Powdered sugar

Mix flour, sour cream and butter.  Divide into 3 equal parts and roll into balls.  Wrap in wax paper and chill overnight. 

Next day, roll in oblong shape (very thin) and spread with jams.  Sprinkle coconut, nuts and cherries.  Roll up like jellyrolls. 

Bake in moderate oven (around 350 degrees) until brown.  Sprinkle with powdered sugar.  Slice and serve.

NOTE:  To make a variety I use different types of Jams or Preserves to make a variety of flavors.  One of mine is with blueberry Preserves and Cherry Preserves.  But use you own imagination and taste.
