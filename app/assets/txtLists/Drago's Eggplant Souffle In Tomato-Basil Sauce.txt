 Heat oil in saute pan, add eggplant cubes, potato, onion, basil and oregano and season to taste with salt. Saute until golden. Add tomato and cook approximately 10 minutes.

 Pour eggplant mixture into food processor and blend until smooth. Add Parmesan cheese, bread crumbs and eggs into processor and blend 5 seconds.

 Lace 8 (6-ounce) timbals with butter. Cover bottom of cup with chopped zucchini and pepper and fill rest of cup with processed eggplant mixture. Cook in bain marie at 350 degrees 40 minutes.

 Remove timbales from oven and let standing warm place 15 minutes.

 When ready to serve, spoon small amount Tomato-Basil Sauce on individual serving plates, then flip souffle cups onto top of each plate. Serve warm. Makes 8 servings.

 Drago serves these individual souffles as appetizers at his restaurant. It's a wonderful use of eggplant, one of the most commonly used vegetables in Sicily. It's essential that you use good Parmesan- the cheese is what rounds out the flavor.

 For Tomato-Basil Sauce:

 Place olive oil and onion in saucepan and saute until golden. Add tomatoes, basil and season to taste with salt. Cook 10 minutes on low heat.

 Melt butter in separate pan, add flour and mix well. Add butter- flour mixture to tomato sauce and cook few more minutes. Remove basil leaves from sauce and blend sauce in blender until smooth and creamy. Makes 2 cups.
