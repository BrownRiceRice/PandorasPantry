--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  dry mustard
     1/2      teaspoon  hot chili powder
       1            lg  pinch cayenne pepper
     1/4           cup  butter or margarine
     1/2           cup  cheddar cheese -- finely grate
       1                egg -- beaten
       1    tablespoon  water -- cold
       1    tablespoon  sesame seeds
       1    tablespoon  poppy seeds

Preheat oven to 400:. Sift flour, salt and spices into a bowl. Cut in butter finely until mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Add grated cheese and mix well. Mix egg with cold water. Add 2 tablespoons of egg mixture to cheese mixture and mix to form a fairly stiff dough. Knead gently on a lightly floured surface.  Roll out dough to a 12x6" rectangle. Trim edges. Cut in half lengthwise and transfer to a baking sheet. Brush each half with remaining egg mixture. Sprinkle 1 half with sesame seeds and the other half with poppy seeds. Cut each half in 10 triangles and separate slightly to prevent sticking. Bake in preheated oven 10-12 minutes or until light golden and cooked through. Cool on a wire rack. Store in an airtight container up to 2 weeks.
