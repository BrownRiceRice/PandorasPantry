       1         pound  coarse ground meat
       1                onion -- chopped
       6   tablespoons  butter
     1/2         pound  tomatoes, peeled -- strained or
       1    tablespoon  tomato paste diluted with:
       1           cup  water
                        salt & pepper to taste
     1/2         pound  thick macaroni
       2                egg whites
       1           cup  parmesan cheese -- grated
       4        sheets  phyllo pastry
                        melted butter
                        -----bechamel sauce-----
       8   tablespoons  butter
      10   tablespoons  flour
       4          cups  hot milk
       2                egg yolks -- lightly beaten
                        salt & pepper to taste

Brown meat and onion with 3 tbs. of the butter, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon during the process. Add tomatoes (or paste w/water) and seasoning, and cook over low heat for abt. 20 min., or until the luquid is absorbed.  Meanwhile, cook macaroni as directed; drain. Brown remaining butter in another pan and pour it over macaroni. Beat egg whites lightly and add.

 Prepare the bechamel, melt the butter and add the flour slowly to it, blending in well.  Add hot milk, stirring it in rapidly with a clean wooden spoon until the sauce thickens.. Remove the sauce from heat; blend in egg yolks.  Pour over macaroni.  Sprinkle with cheese.

 Butter a round cake pan and spread 2 phyllo sheets into it (let sheets extend over the pan; do not trim). Brush with melted butter. Spread half the macaroni on the phyllo, top with the chopped meat; add the rest of the macaroni, and fold edges of the phyllo up over it. Use the 2 remaining phyllo sheets for the top:  butter each and trim to fit the pan. Bake in preheated oven at 375 F. for abt. 20 min., or until golden brown. Cool; turn out onto a platter.
