       2          cups  all-purpose flour
       2   tablespoons  sugar
       1       package  Fleischmann's. Rapid Rise Yeast
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
       1    tablespoon  dried parsley
       1      teaspoon  dried thyme leaves
     1/2      teaspoon  dried rosemary leaves
     1/2      teaspoon  ground sage
     3/4           cup  evaporated milk
     1/4           cup  water
     1/4           cup  butter or margarine
       1                egg

In large bowl, combine 1 1/2 cups flour, sugar, undissolved yeast, salt and herbs. Heat milk, water and butter until very warm (125: to 130:); stir into dry ingredients. Stir in egg and remaining 1/2 cup flour to make stiff batter.

Spoon batter into 12 greased 2 1/2- W 1 1/2-inch muffin cups. Cover with wax paper; let rise in warm, draft-free place until almost doubled in size, about 30 minutes.

Bake in preheated 400:F oven for 14 to 16 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from muffin cups; cool on wire rack.
