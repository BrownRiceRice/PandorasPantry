      48                fresh shrimp (2 lbs)
       8        ounces  cream cheese
       8        ounces  blue cheese
       8        ounces  sour cream
       2   tablespoons  garlic -- finely chopped
       4   tablespoons  parsley -- finely chopped
     1/2           cup  sauterne wine
       6                lemon wedges
       6                alum foil pieces 12/12"

Cook, peel & clean shrimp & let cool.  Blend together the cheeses & sour cream, being careful to get a smooth and even mixture. Cheese sauce will be thin. Add the chopped garlic & parsley & mix well.  Add the wine. (A bit more or less wine may be required to get the desired thickness of the mixture.) Place about 4 oz. of the mixture on a piece of the foil; add 8 shrimp (or more if you want) and top with a piece of lemon. Fold over 2 sides of foil, then ends, so a tight package is formed to prevent leaking. (You could use ramekins in place of foil) Bake in oven at 350 degrees for about 15 minutes.
