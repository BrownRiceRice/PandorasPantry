--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1         pound  butter
       2     teaspoons  fresh ground black pepper
     1/4           cup  peanut oil
       2                bay leaves -- crumbled
       3        cloves  garlic -- chopped
       1    tablespoon  paprika
       2   tablespoons  rosemary
       2     teaspoons  lemon juice
       1      teaspoon  chopped basil
       2        pounds  raw shrimp in their shells
       1      teaspoon  chopped thyme
                        salt
       1      teaspoon  chopped oregano
       2   tablespoons  cayenne pepper

Shrimp should be of a size to number 30-35 per pound. Melt the Butter and Oil in a flameproof baking dish. Add the Garlic, herbs, Peppers, bay leaves, Paprika, and Lemon juice, and bring to a boil. Turn the heat down and simmer 10 minutes, stirring frequently. Remove the dish from the heat and let the flavors marry at least 30 minutes. This hot Butter Sauce can be made a day in advance and refrigerated. Preheat the oven to 450F. Reheat the Sauce, add the shrimp, and cook over medium heat until the shrimp just turn pink, then bake in the oven about 30 minutes more. Taste for seasoning, adding Salt if necessary.
