  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       5          cups  all-purpose flour (5 to 5 1/2 cups)
     1/3           cup  plus 1 tablespoon sugar
       2      packages  Fleischmann's. Rapid Rise Yeast
       4     teaspoons  grated lemon peel
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     2/3           cup  milk
     1/3           cup  water
     1/3           cup  butter or margarine
       1                egg white
       2                eggs -- at room temperature
       1           cup  chopped or pitted dates -- snipped
     1/2           cup  sliced almonds -- lightly toasted

Combine 2 cups flour, 1/3 cup sugar, undissolved yeast, lemon peel and salt. Heat milk, water and butter until very warm (120: to 130:F). Stir into dry ingredients. Stir in 2 eggs, dates, 1/4 cup almonds and enough remaining flour to make soft dough. Knead on floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 6 to 8 minutes. Cover; let rest 10 minutes.

Reserve 1/3 of dough. Divide remaining dough into three pieces; roll each to 30-inch rope. Braid ropes. Place on greased baking sheet. Form into ring; pinch ends to seal. Divide remaining dough into 8 pieces; form into oval rolls. Place on separate greased baking sheet. Cover wreath and rolls; let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 30 to 45 minutes. 

Beat egg white with 1 tablespoon water; brush on wreath. Sprinkle with remaining sugar and almonds. Bake at 350:F for 15 to 20 minutes for rolls and 30 to 35 minutes for wreath, or until done. Switch positions of sheets after 10 minutes for even browning. Remove from sheets; cool on wire racks. Frost and decorate rolls as desired. 

Makes 1 basket and 8 rolls
