       1    Tablespoon  Vinegar
       1           Cup  Firmly Packed Light Brown Sugar
     3/4           Cup  Seedless Raisins

Pour boiling water over peaches; let stand until skins can be easily removed.  Dip in cold water, peel.



Remove pits and red fibers; cut into chunks.



Place immediately in vinegar water to prevent browning.



In saucepan combine brown sugar and next 4 ingredients.  Add cloves and cinnamon tied in cheesecloth bag.



Drain peaches; add to syrup.  Simmer 1 hour, stirring occasionally.



Remove spice bag.  Continue simmering while quickly packing 1 clean hot jar at a time.  Fill to within 1/2" of top making sure syrup covers fruit.



Seal each jar at once.  Process 5 minutes in boiling-water bath.



Make 4 - 5 half-pints
