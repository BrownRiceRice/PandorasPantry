       1           cup  rice grains
       6          cups  water

                        salt and pepper -- to taste

In a large non-stick soup pot over medium heat, saute garlic in oil until lightly brown.  Add ginger and onion, stir for a minute.  Add chicken pieces and fish  sauce and cook for another 3 minutes.  Add rice, water and a little salt and pepper.  Cover and simmer in medium low heat for about 40 minutes or until the consistency of a light creamed soup has been reached.  

Stir occasionally while cooking.  Correct seasonings to taste.  Stir in a small amount of sliced green onions.  If rice soup becomes too thick, add a little water to thin it a bit.  Garnish individual bowl servings with sliced green onions just before servings. Tips: If you prefer, sprinkle a little lemon juice on the soup servings. This will give a pleasant tartness to the dish.
