Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Butter a large loaf pan. Cream butter with sugars and beat until fluffy. Add eggs and beat well. Sift together dry ingredients. Beat into egg mixture. Fold in carrots and walnuts. Mix thoroughly. Pour into prepared 9x5x3-inch pan. Bake approximately 1 hour. Cool on rack. Recipe can be doubled successfully. Makes a dense loaf that doesn't crumble, making it great for spreads or mini-sandwiches. Recipe from Martha Stewart Entertaining.
