     1/2           cup  sugar
       3    tablespoon  water
     1/3           cup  pine nuts
       1           cup  whipping cream
                        well chilled
       1      teaspoon  vanilla extract
       2          pint  strawberries
                        hulled -- quartered

Preparation time: 15 minutes.  Cooking time: 5 minutes.  Vanilla yogurt can be used in place of whipped cream.  1.  Lightly oil a flat baking sheet. Put the sugar in a small heavy saucepan; drizzle water over and swirl the pan so all the sugar is moistened. Cook over medium-high heat, watching closely, until sugar is melted and mixture is a rich medium brown. Add pine nuts and remove from heat.  Immediately pour onto baking sheet and cool completely.  2.  Break cooled nut mixture into pieces. Grind to a powder in a food processor or blender.  3.  Whip cream until it holds soft peaks.  Mix in vanilla and half of ground nut mixture.  4.  To serve, place a spoonful of whipped cream into serving bowls; top with berries and a small sprinkling of nut powder.  Chicago Tribune, 08/05/93.
