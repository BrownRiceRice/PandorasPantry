     1/2         pound  chorizo -- casings removed, cru
       1         large  onion -- cut into medium dice
      14        cloves  garlic -- coarsley chopped
     1/2           cup  dry sherry
     1/4           cup  olive oil
       3        pounds  boneless pork shoulder -- or butt, cut into 1"
       1    tablespoon  ground cumin
       1    tablespoon  coriander
       1    tablespoon  fennel seed
       2     teaspoons  dried oregano
       1         quart  beef stock -- or low-salt beef bro
      15        ounces  hominy, canned -- drained
                        juice from 3 limes
       1           cup  green onions -- finely chopped
       1           cup  cilantro -- finely chopped
                        salt and pepper, to taste

In a large pan, saute the chorizo over moderate heat til it loses its pink colour, about 3 min.  Remove with slotted spoon.  Saute onion and garlic in chorizo fat over moderate heat for 10 min.  Add sherry, and cook 4-5 min, til the liquid evaporates.  Add to the chorizo and set aside. Heat the olive oil in a heavy-bottomed pot.  When hot but not smoking, brown the pork cubes on all sides.  Return the pork and chorizo mixture to the pot, add the spices, oregano and beef stock.  Bring to a boil over high heat, scraping the bottom of the pot to remove any particles. Reduce heat to moderate, and cook 2 hours or til meat is tender.  Add the hominy and lime juice and cook 10 minutes.  Mix in the green onions and cilantro just before serving.  Serve hot. We usually eat it on top of rice.
