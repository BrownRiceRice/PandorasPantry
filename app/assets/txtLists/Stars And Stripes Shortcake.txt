       6          cups  fresh berries -- washed
     1/2           cup  + 1 Tbsp. sugar -- divided use
                        Non-stick cooking spray
   1 1/2          cups  oat bran
       2          cups  all-purpose flour
       1    tablespoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil
       2         large  egg whites
     2/3           cup  skim milk

 Combine berries with 1/4 cup sugar and let stand for 30 minutes at room temperature.

 Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Spray cookie sheet with cooking spray.

 Combine oat bran and flour with 1/4 cup sugar, baking powder and salt.

 Cut oil into oat bran mixture with pastry blender or with fork until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.

 Combine egg whites with milk and add to oat bran, stirring until just moistened.

 Sprinkle cutting board with a little flour.  With rolling pin, roll the shortcake dough to 1/2" thickness.

With medium-size star-shaped cookie cutter, cut dough into stars.  Try to keep dough scraps to a minimum and reroll dough only 1 time so it doesn't toughen.  Place stars on cookie sheet.  There should be 16 stars.  Sprinkle with sugar.

 Bake stars for 10 minutes or until they are lightly browned and firm to the touch.  Remove stars from cookie sheet and cool for 10 minutes on a wire rack.

 Place 2 stars in each serving bowl and cover with fruit.
