      16        ounces  (2) frozen lobster tails
     1/2           cup  water
     1/4           cup  butter or margarine
       1    tablespoon  lemon juice
     1/2      teaspoon  finely shredded orange peel
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
       1          dash  ground ginger
       1          dash  paprika

Place frozen lobster tails in a shallow baking dish.  Micro-cook, covered, on 30% power for 7 to 8 minutes or till thawed, rotating dish a quarter-turn once.  The tails are thawed when the shells are flexible enough to bend.  Using a heavy knife, cut through the center of the top shells.  Continue cutting through meat but not through undershells. Spread the tails open, butterfly style, so meat is on top.  Return to shallow baking dish.  Pour water atop.  Micro-cook, covered, on 50% power for 6 to 8 minutes or just till meat is opaque, rotating dish a quarter-turn every minute.  (Shield cooked meat with small pieces of foil, if necessary, to prevent overcooking.)  Let stand, covered, for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, combine butter or margarine, lemon juice, orange peel, salt, ginger and paprika.  Micro-cook, uncovered, on 100% power for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes or till butter is melted.  Mix well.  Drizzle lobster tails with butter mixture.
