--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       2          cups  water
       1         ounce  semi-sweet chocolate -- broken in 1/2 oz pie
       2          cups  sugar
   1 1/2          cups  brewed coffee -- full strength
       6        ounces  unsweetened chocolate -- broken into 1/2-oz
                        pieces
       1      teaspoon  pure vanilla extract

Heat the water, sugar, and coffee in a 2 1/2-qt saucepan over medium-high heat. Whisk to dissolve the sugar. Bring the mixture to a boil. Place the unsweetened and semisweet chocolate in a stainless steel bowl. Remove the boiling liquid from the heat and pour 1 cup over the chocolate. Allow to stand for 5 minutes. Vigorously whisk until completely smooth, about 3 minutes. Add the remaining hot liquid and whisk until smooth. Cool in an ice-water bath to a temperature of 40-45:, about 18-20 minutes. When cold, add the vanilla and stir to incorporate. Freeze in an ice cream freezer following the manufacturer's instructions. Transfer semi-frozen sorbet to a plastic container, securely cover the container, then place for several hours before serving. Serve within 2 days. Makes 2 quarts.
