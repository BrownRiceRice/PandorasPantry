     1/4           cup  dry white wine
       2   tablespoons  water

* Granules (try to use the low-sodium kind such as Wylers) ** I use olive oil instead for a fresher taste. Thaw scallops, if frozen. Cook pasta according to package directions, EXCEPT omit oil; drain and keep warm. Meanwhile, for sauce, stir together wine, water, cornstarch, and chicken bouillon granules; set aside. In a large skillet, cook garlic in hot margarine or butter for 30 seconds. Add mushrooms, green onions, and carrot; stir-fry for 2 to 3 minutes or till carrot is crisp-tender. Stir sauce. Add sauce, scallops, and snipped parsley to vegetable mixture in skillet. cook and stir till the sauce is thickened and bubbly. Cook and stir for 2 minutes more or until the scallops are opaque. Serve with lemon wedges. Yield: Makes 4 (1 1/4 cup servings. One serving equals: 2 lean meat exchange; 1 1/2 starch/bread exchange; 1 vegetable exchange; 1/2 fat exchange.
