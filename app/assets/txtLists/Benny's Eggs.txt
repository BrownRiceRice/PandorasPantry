  SAUCE-In a large metal bowl, whisk together egg, lemon juice and orange rind over a pan of boiling water for 1 minute. Gradually whisk in butter until sauce is smooth and well blended. It will be rather thin while warm, but will thicken as it cools slightly. EGGS-Crack eggs into shallow pan of boiling water.  Poach until done to your liking. Meanwhile, toast the bread. Spread with cream cheese. Top with the salmon. Place on plate. Top with 2 eggs per serving. Spoon sauce over. Serve with oranges and mint or parsley.
