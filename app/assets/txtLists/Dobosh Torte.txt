                        -----cake-----
       6                eggs -- separated
     3/4           cup  cake flour -- sifted twice
   1 1/2          cups  confectioners' sugar -- sifted
       1      teaspoon  baking powder
                        -----chocolate buttercream-----
       1           cup  sugar
     1/3           cup  water
     1/4      teaspoon  cream of tartar
       4                egg yolks
   1 1/2          cups  sweet butter -- softened
       6        ounces  semi-sweet chocolate morsels
       4   tablespoons  strong coffee
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract

CAKE:  Beat the yolks at medium speed until they are lemon in color, and thick.  Add the sugar and continue to beat until well blended. Sift the baking powder into the four. Then fold into the egg yolk mixture. Beat the whites until stiff, then fold them into the mix gently. Grease the pans - two round if making four layers, or two loaf if making seven. Line the bottoms with wax paper, that has been greased. Pour in the batter and bake in preheated oven at 350:F for 15-20 minutes or until tester comes out clean. Turn out immediately and remove the wax paper. Cool on racks top side up. Make thin slices when cool and start to frost with a cut side up and then keep layering. Cover the entire torte with the buttercream and then melt down semi sweet chocolate to melting point stirring well. Chill the cake and when firm pour over the dark chocolate making sure that the sides are covered. Chill to harden. Remove to new plate so drips are not seen. 

FROSTING: Mix sugar, water and cream of tartar in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Boil over med heat for to 234 degree on candy thermometer. In a large bowl with a mixer beat the eggs until thick. Add the butter in small pieces and beat well. Combine chocolate and the coffee in a saucepan and heat gently until chocolate is melted and mixed. Add this and the vanilla to the bowl and beat well. If buttercream starts to not hold up refrigerate for a few mins and then beat again.
