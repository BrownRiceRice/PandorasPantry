  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1 1/2        pounds  ground lamb, very lean -- thrice ground
       3  medium clove  garlic -- minced
     3/4           cup  minced fresh mint
   1 1/2   tablespoons  minced fresh sage
       1      teaspoon  dried sage
       6   tablespoons  olive oil
                        Salt
                        Ground black pepper
     3/4           cup  dry bread crumbs
                        Green Peppercorn Sauce -- (see recipe)

TO PREPARE: Mix first 4 ingredients plus 4 tablespoons oil, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a bowl. Cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours. (Can be refrigerated overnight.)

TO COOK: Prepare the Green Peppercorn Sauce recipe.

To finish the kabobs, heat the grill. If using wooden skewers, soak eight 8-inch skewers in water for at least 15 minutes. Stir breadcrumbs into lamb mixture. Divide mixture into 8 portions. Making 1 kabob at a time, form a portion of lamb into a compacted 4- by 1-inch cylinder. Skewer the lamb cylinder lengthwise. Repeat with remaining lamb to form 7 more kabobs. Brush kabobs with remaining 2 tablespoons oil.

Grill kabobs, turning occasionally, until browned, about 10 minutes for medium.

TO SERVE: Transfer 2 kabobs to each plate. Drizzle a portion of the Green Peppercorn Sauce over kabobs and serve.
