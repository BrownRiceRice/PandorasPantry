--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4         Pound  Fresh Mushrooms
       3   Tablespoons  Butter
       2     Teaspoons  Flour
                        Salt And Pepper -- to taste
       1           Cup  Heavy Cream -- heated
       6                Filet Mignons
       6                French Bread Slice
       6   Tablespoons  Butter
     1/2           Cup  Scotch

Slice mushrooms and saute in 3 Tbsp. butter.  Add flour and salt and pepper to taste.  Blend well.  Stir in warm cream.  Keep well heated.

In a separate skillet saute the filets in hot butter for 2 1/2 minutes per side (for rare).

Saute bread slices in 6 Tbsp. butter, turning often to prevent butter from being absorbed.  Arrange bread slices in a ring on well heated platter.

Top with the filets and arrange the mushroom sauce in the center.  Stir the Scotch into pan juices, boil up for a minute or two and spoon sauce over the meat.

Additional sauce can be passed separately.
