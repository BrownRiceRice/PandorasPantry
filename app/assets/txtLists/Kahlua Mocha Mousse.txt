--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   2 1/2        ounces  bittersweet chocolate -- cut in small pieces
   1 1/2        ounces  unsweetened chocolate -- cut in small pieces
       2   tablespoons  coffee -- very strong brew
       2   tablespoons  kahlua
       2                eggs; room temperature -- separated
     1/4           cup  sugar
       1         pinch  cream of tartar
     1/2           cup  heavy cream -- well chilled
                        -----chocolate leaves (garnish)-----
       3        ounces  bittersweet chocolate
      24                decorative leaves -- non-poisonous lemon
                        florists leaves

For the Mousse: In the top of a double boiler, set over barely simmering water, melt the chocolates with the coffee and the Kahlua, stirring occasionally. In a bowl with an electric mixer, beat the egg yolks with 3 tb. of the sugar until the mixture is thick and pale and stir in the chocolate mixture. In another bowl, beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt until they are frothy, add the cream of tartar, and beat the whites until they hold soft peaks. Beat in the remaining 1 tb. sugar gradually and beat the whites until they just hold stiff peaks. Stir 1/4 of the whites into the chocolate mixture, then fold in the remaining whites and the whipped cream, gently but thoroughly. Pour the mousse into a 1 qt. shallow dish and chill, covered, for at least two hours. (This may be made a day in advance) Before serving, arrange some of the chocolate leaves on the mousse, and serve the remaining leaves separately. Chocolate leaves: In the top of a double boiler set over barely simmering water, melt the chocolate. with a spoon, coat the back (non-shiny) side of each leaf with the chocolate, being careful not to let the chocolate drip onto the shiny side. Place the leaves, chocolate side up on a jelly roll pan lined with wax paper, and prop the edges of the leaves with pieces of foil or paper towel to allow the edges to curl.  Chill the leaves for 20 minutes, or until the chocolate has hardened, and, working quickly, peel off the lemon leaves. (If the chocolate gets too soft, chill the leaves for 5 minutes more, or until hardened). Keep the leaves chilled until just before serving. Makes 24 leaves.
