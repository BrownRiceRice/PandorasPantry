--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1         pound  short-grain rice
       2   tablespoons  mirin (sweet sake)
     1/4           cup  rice vinegar
       2   tablespoons  sugar
       2     teaspoons  salt
      24         large  shrimp -- cooked
       2     teaspoons  wasabi powder
       1         sheet  nori

Wash rice; drain 30 minutes; cook. Heat mirin, vinegar, sugar, salt, until boiling. Cool. Remove rice from heat and leave 10 minutes. Turn into large shallow dish; pour vinegar dressing over. Mix gently until rice is at room temp. Shape sushi into neat ovals. Peel shrimp leaving tails. Split down the underside-not all the way through-and flatten. Mix wasabi. Dab small amount onto rice ovals; top with shrimp. Wrap a thin strip of nori around each sushi. Makes 24.
