       1                Brownie mix
       5                Egg yolks
     3/4           cup  Sugar
       1       package  Unflavored gelatin
     1/4           cup  Cold water
     1/2           cup  Bourbon
       3          cups  Heavy cream

Bake 1 brownie mix according to directions, but bake a few minutes less, in the bottoms of 2 pie tins. 
Beat egg yokes until thick and lemon colored. Slowly beat in sugar. Soften gelatin in cold water and add 1/3 of the bourbon. Heat this mixture of bourbon over boiling water until gelatin dissolves. Pour into yolks and stir briskly. Add remaining bourbon. Whip 1-cup of cream and fold into mixture. Pour filling into brownie crust and chill 4 hours. 
Top with remaining cream whipped with a pinch of salt & sugar to taste. Sprinkle shaved chocolate on top.
