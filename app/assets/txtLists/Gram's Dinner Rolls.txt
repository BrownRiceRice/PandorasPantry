--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1           cup  milk -- scalded
     1/2           cup  shortening
     1/2           cup  sugar
       1      teaspoon  salt
       1                yeast cake -- or 1 pkg dry
       3                eggs -- beaten
   4 1/2          cups  flour

Combine hot milk, shortening, sugar, and salt.  Mix but don't worry if shortening doesn't all melt.  Cool to lukewarm.  Add yeast and mix.  Add eggs and mix.  Add flour and mix well to make a smooth soft dough.  (This is not the kind of dough you have to knead - it will be very soft and sticky.)  Let rise to double in volume. Punch the dough down and refrigerate until cold.

Turn chilled dough out onto floured pastry cloth and knead briefly. Divide dough into thirds.  Roll out one third at a time.  Roll into a large circle about 1/8 inch thick.  Brush surface of dough with melted butter.  Cut circle of dough into 8 pie shaped wedges.  Roll up each wedge starting at the wide end.  Place each roll on baking sheet and curve it into a crescent shape.  (Be sure to put the pointy end on the bottom otherwise roll may start to unroll as it rises or bakes.)  Brush tops of rolls with melted butter.  Cover with a cloth and let rise until almost double.  Bake at 350 F for 16 minutes.

Note:  These are fairly large rolls.  If you prefer smaller rolls divide dough into quarters instead of thirds.
