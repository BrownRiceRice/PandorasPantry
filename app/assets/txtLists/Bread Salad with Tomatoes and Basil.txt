       2   tablespoons  red wine vinegar

TO PREPARE AND SERVE: Dip each slice of bread into a large bowl of cold water, then transfer to a colander set inside the sink; let drain for 15 minutes. Gently squeeze each slice of bread to remove excess water, then cut the slices into medium dice.
Transfer bread cubes to a large nonreactive bowl. Add the remaining ingredients including 1 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper; toss the ingredients to combine. Cover and chill for 1 hour. Serve.
