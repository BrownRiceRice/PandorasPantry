   2 1/4          cups  all-purpose flour

       2          cups  peeled apples -- chopped
       1           cup  cranberries -- fresh or frozen
                        --coarsely chopped
       1           cup  chopped nuts
                        orange butter cream:
     1/3           cup  butter -- softened
       3        ounces  cream cheese -- softened
       1      teaspoon  vanilla extract

       1      teaspoon  orange peel -- grated
       2     teaspoons  milk -- to 4 teaspoons

Preheat oven to 350 degrees; grease a 15 x 10 x 1-inch jelly roll pan.  In a large mixer bowl, combine the sugar, butter, eggs, orange peel and vanilla extract.  Beat on medium speed, scraping the bowl often, for 2 to 3 minutes until well mixed.  Reduce the speed to low; add the flour, baking soda and salt.  Continue beating, scraping the bowl often, for 1 to 2 minutes until well mixed.  By hand, stir in the apples, cranberries and nuts.  Spread in the prepared pan.  Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.  Cool completely. In a small mixer bowl, combine the butter, cream cheese and vanilla extract.  Beat on medium speed, scraping the bowl often, for 1 to 2 minutes until well mixed.  Reduce the speed to low.  Continue beating, gradually adding the powdered sugar, orange peel and enough milk for desired spreading consistency.  Thinly frost the cooled bars; cut into bars.
