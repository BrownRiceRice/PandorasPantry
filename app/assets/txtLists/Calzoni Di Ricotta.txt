   3 1/2          cups  flour
                        salt
     1/2           cup  shortening -- diced
       2                eggs -- beaten
                        lemon juice -- 1
       1           cup  ricotta
     1/2           cup  ham -- diced
     1/2           cup  provolone -- diced
                        egg yolks
     1/2      teaspoon  pepper -- freshly ground
                        egg white -- whisked
                        oil -- for frying

Dough-Add the salt to the flour and on a working surface make a well in the center. Add the eggs, shortening and lemon juice. Mix it all together to make a smooth dough. Filling-Mix the ricotta, egg yolks, ham and provolone. Add the salt and pepper to taste. Mix well until thoroughly combined. Assembly-Flatten the dough and roll out into fairly thin sheets. Cut 4 8" circles. Divide the filling between the four circles. Brush the edges with the egg whites and fold over. Close the edges securely. Cook-Deep fry until golden brown. Drain well on paper towels and serve hot. ***these may be made ahead of time and reheated in the oven. They may also be frozen to use at a later date.
