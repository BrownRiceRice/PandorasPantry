--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  vegetable shortening
                        --butter flavored
   1 1/4          cups  light brown sugar, packed
       2   tablespoons  milk
       1    tablespoon  vanilla extract
       1                egg
       2          cups  all-purpose flour
       1      teaspoon  salt
     3/4      teaspoon  baking soda
       1           cup  semisweet chocolate chips
       1           cup  pecans -- coarsely chopped
                        icing:
   1 1/4          cups  powdered sugar
       3   tablespoons  vegetable shortening
       2     teaspoons  milk
       1      teaspoon  light corn syrup
                        red and green chewy candies
                        --or gum drops

Preheat oven to 375 degrees; line 4 cookie sheets with foil and lightly grease the foil.  In a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed, beat the brown sugar, shortening, milk and vanilla extract until well blended. Beat in the egg.  In a medium bowl, combine the flour, salt and baking soda.  With a spoon, stir into the shortening mixture just until blended.  Stir in the chocolate chips and pecans.  Divide the dough into quarters; divide each quarter into 12 pieces.  Roll each piece into a 1-inch ball. Arrange the balls on the cookie sheets almost touching to form an 8-inch circle.  Flatten the balls slightly with your fingers.  Repeat with the remaining balls to make 3 more wreaths.  Bake one cookie sheet at a time for 12 to 14 minutes, or until the wreaths are lightly browned.  Do not overbake.  Cool completely before removing from the cookie sheet.      Meanwhile, prepare the icing.  In a small bowl with the mixer on medium speed, beat the powdered sugar, shortening, milk and corn syrup until smooth.  If too thick, thin with a little milk; if too thin, add more powdered sugar.  The icing may be covered and refrigerated for up to 1 week. Makes 1 1/2 cups.  Spread or pipe the icing over the cooled wreaths.  Cut the red and green candies as needed for flowers and leaves.  Place in clusters around the wreath. Makes 4 wreaths.
