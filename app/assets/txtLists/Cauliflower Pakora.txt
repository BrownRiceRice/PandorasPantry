--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        REQUIRED INGREDIENTS
       2        pounds  cauliflower -- cut into bite-size-pieces
     1/4           cup  yogurt (thick)
       1           cup  chick pea flour
     1/4      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  carom seed (ajwain in Hindi/vaamu in Telug
     1/4      teaspoon  red chili powder
     1/4           cup  water
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Oil -- to deep fry

In a bowl mix all the ingredients except cauliflower pieces. The batter must have the same consistency as that of a cake.

Dip cauliflower pieces in the batter such that they are completely covered with the batter.

In a deep skillet heat oil on medium and when oil is hot add the batter-covered cauliflower pieces. Fry until this batch is about half done (just about when the color of the batter starts to change) and remove from heat and keep aside.

Do the same for all the batches. In the end take the first batch and refry them until they turn brown. Repeat for the other batches. 

Goes well with ketchup.
