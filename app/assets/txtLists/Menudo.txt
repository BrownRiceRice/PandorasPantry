For starters, you must place the tripe, water, onions, garlic, salt, and
pepper in a large kettle and let it simmer over low heat for
about two hours, skimming fat as necessary. 

Next, you must toast the chiles well. Then you slit them open and remove
the seeds and veins. You must grind them until they are very fine and then
you add them to the kettle. 

Continuing, you can add the cilantro and let it simmer for about two
hours. At last, you can add the hominy and cook for another thirty
minutes. Finally, it is a good idea to serve with lime wedges. This recipe
will serve from ten to about twelve people
