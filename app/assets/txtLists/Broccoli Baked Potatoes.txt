--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       6        medium  Idaho potatoes
       3        stalks  broccoli
     1/4           cup  skim milk
       1           cup  shredded Cheddar cheese
     1/8    tablespoon  pepper

Scrub potatoes. Make shallow slits around the middle as if you were cutting the potatoes in half lengthwise. Bake at 350: until done, 30 to 60 minutes, depending on size. 

Peel broccoli stems. Steam whole stalks just until tender and chop finely. 

Carefully slice the potatoes in half and scoop the insides into a bowl with the broccoli. Add the milk, 3/4 cup cheese and pepper. Mash together until the mixture is pale green with dark green flecks. 

Heap into the potato jackets and sprinkle with remaining cheese. Return in oven to heat through (about 15 minutes).
