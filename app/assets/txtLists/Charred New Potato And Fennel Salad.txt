       2        pounds  small red potatoes -- washed
       2        medium  fennel bulbs; trimmed -- quartered lengthwise
     1/2           cup  light-tasting olive oil
                        salt
                        freshly ground pepper
     1/3           cup  pitted nicoise olives -- chopped
     1/3           cup  green onions -- chopped
       6            tb  red wine vinegar -- (6 to 7)

Preparation time: 25 minutes.  Cooking time: 25 minutes.

 1.  Set broiler rack about 6 inches from heat.  Turn on broiler.

 2.  Toss potatoes and fennel in 1/4 cup olive oil; reserve any extra oil. Spread in single layer on broiler pan. Lightly season with salt and pepper. Broil until blistered and slightly blackened, turning once, about 5 minutes per side.  Bake in 400-degree oven until just tender, about 15-20 minutes. Do not overcook potatoes.

 3.  When cool enough to handle, cut potatoes and fennel into 1/2-inch dice. Toss with all oil, 6 tablespoons vinegar and remaining ingredients. Season to taste. Add remaining tablespoon vinegar if needed. Can be made several hours ahead and kept at room temperature or a day ahead and refrigerated, covered airtight. Let come to room temperature before serving. Adjust seasoning.

 'This salad would be a great accompaniment to any grilled meat or poultry. Try to make it several hours or a day ahead so the flavors have a chance to deepen and meld together.'  From the Four Seasons, Abby Mandel, The Weekend Cook, Chicago Tribune, 7/18/93.  Christie Aspegren, September 93 Round Robin.
