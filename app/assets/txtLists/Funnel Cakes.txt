  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       2           cup  flour
       1      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
       2                eggs
   1 1/2           cup  milk

Mix the ingredients together: Heat cooking oil in a deep fryer or skillet until very hot. Put batter into a funnel (be sure to cover the spout with one finger), then, holding the funnel over the hot oil ( use extreme caution when cooking with hot oil), release some of the batter in circular motions to form one funnel cake.  The funnel cake will rise quickly and expand, so be careful about how much batter you use for the first one until you get the "feel" for cooking it. Cook to a light golden brown on both sides, then remove from the oil and place on paper towels to drain.. Sprinkle with powdered sugar and serve while still warm!
