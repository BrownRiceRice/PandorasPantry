       5                cucumbers (medium) -- seeded
       2     teaspoons  salt
     1/2           cup  lemon juice
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  msg (optional)
       1    tablespoon  white wine vinegar
       2     teaspoons  sesame seeds -- toasted

Peel cucumbers lengthwise, leaving thin green stripes. Slice very thinly into a large glass or stainless steel bowl. Add salt and mix with hand until cucumber slices are quite limp. Set aside for 45 minutes. Meanwhile, mix lemon juice, sugar, MSG and white wine vinegar. Transfer cucumbers to a strainer and squeeze as much liquid as possible out of the cucumbers. Discard salt water.  Add cucumbers to the lemon juice mixture. Ground the toasted sesame seeds and stir into the salad.
