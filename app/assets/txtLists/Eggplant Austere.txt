       1         large  eggplant
       1          pint  fresh raw oysters
     1/2        medium  white onion -- chopped
     1/4         pound  fresh mushrooms -- sliced
       1           jar  pimientos -- (2 oz.)
       2                Eggs
                        Salt
     1/4         pound  butter
       1           Rib  celery -- chopped
       2        slices  whole wheat bread
       1       Handful  fresh parsley

 First:  slice top off eggplant length-wise (that means laying it on  its side - not the stem).  Scoop out pulp from large piece and set pulp aside for use later.  Sprinkle inside of eggplant with salt, replace its hat and refrigerate in a Pyrex baking dish until time to stuff,

 Second:  preheat oven to 300 degrees.  Place two slices of whole wheat bread in oven to dry out while it is heating.

 Third:  melt butter in heavy skillet over medium heat.  Braise with the lid on the following chopped items until soft:  cubed eggplant pulp, sliced fresh mushrooms, chopped celery, and onion.  You know already to wash it all well in cold water to avoid grit in the food.

 Fourth:  add drained oysters, pimientos, dried-out bread which you have pulled into small pieces, and parsley to the above.  Have you discovered how mush easier it is to cut parsley with kitchen shears than with a knife?  Stir.

 Fifth:  beat eggs until lemon-colored and add to the above.  Turn fire to low and continue cooking for 5 minutes by the clock, stirring constantly.  Remove from fire and salt to taste.

 Sixth:  stuff eggplant.  At this point, you can put the whole business in the refrigerator, covered of course, and wait until an hour before serving time to take it out.

 Seventh:  pour 1/4 inch water into the bottom of the baking dish.  Make a foil tent which will seal the eggplant in the dish but not mash on the top of it.  Place in preheated 300 degree oven and bake 45 minutes.  Don't overcook this one.  The eggplant will collapse.  I learned this through bitter experience.
