     1/2         pound  small zucchini
     1/2         pound  small crookneck squash
       2   tablespoons  lemon juice
     1/4           cup  salad oil
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
       1          dash  pepper -- ground cumin
       1                green onion -- thinly sliced
     1/3           cup  diced green chilies
     1/3           cup  pimento-stuffed olives
       1       package  (3 oz.) cream cheese
       1         small  avocado
                        lettuce leaves
                        fresh coriander (cilantro)

Cut zucchini and squash crosswise in 1/4 inch-thick slices. Cut onions in half crosswise. Cut avocado in  3/4-inch cubes.

Steam zucchini and crookneck squash over boiling water until crisp-tender (about 3 minutes).  Plunge into ice water to cool; drain well. In a large bowl, combine lemon juice, oil, salt pepper, and cumin. Add drained squash and stir lightly; chill for 30 minutes.  Add onion, chilies, olives, and cheese.  Peel and pit avocado; cut into small cubes. Add to salad and mix lightly. To serve, arrange lettuce leaves on 4 salad plates.  Mound equal portions of salad on each plate.  Garnish each salad with a sprig of coriander.
