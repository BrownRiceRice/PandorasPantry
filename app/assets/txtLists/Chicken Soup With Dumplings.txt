--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       2   tablespoons  butter
       1         small  onion -- minced
       9          cups  chicken stock
                        salt
                        white pepper -- freshly ground
     1/2      teaspoon  thyme
       1         pinch  nutmeg -- freshly ground
       1           cup  all-purpose flour
       2                eggs

In a large saucepan, melt the butter.  Add the onion and cook over moderate heat until softened, about 3 minutes.  Stir in 8 cups of the chicken stock and bring to a simmer.  Season with salt and white pepper to taste.  

Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan, combine the remaining 1 cup stock with the thyme, nutmeg, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a pinch of white pepper. Bring to a boil over high heat.  Remove from the heat and beat in the flour until thoroughly blended.  Let the mixture cool slightly,  then beat in the eggs, one at a time.  

Drop tablespoons of the dumpling mixture into the simmering soup and cook until the dumplings begin to firm, about 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat, cover the saucepan and set aside to steam the dumplings for 3 minutes before serving.
