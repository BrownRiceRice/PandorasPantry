       2          cups  sugar
   1 1/2          cups  corn syrup
       1      teaspoon  vinegar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        Green food coloring
       5        quarts  popped popcorn -- unsalted
                        Colored sugar crystals
       1         Large  gumdrops

Combine sugar, water, corn syrup, vinegar and salt in a heavy saucepan. Bring to a boil and cook over medium heat until mixture reaches 250 degrees Fahrenheit on a candy thermometer.
Remove one cup of hot syrup; add green food coloring and mix well. Pour over two quarts of popcorn and stir to coat. Press in buttered 9-inch square pan to a depth of 1 inch. Pour remaining syrup over the other three quarts of popcorn. When well-coated, form three small balls, 2 inches in diameter; roll in colored sugar.
Press remaining coated popcorn into buttered 10-inch springform pan to a depth of 1 inch. When popcorn is firm, remove from pans. Roll gumdrops and cut to make a mouth; use large gumdrop for nose; jelly rings for eyes, and cut licorice string and shape into eyebrows.
Cut popcorn in 9-inch pan diagonally in half to make two triangles. Form hat by curving 9-inch uncut edge of one to fit head. Cut remaining triangle in half; trim to make bow tie. Secure hat, colored balls and bow tie to clown head with toothpicks.
