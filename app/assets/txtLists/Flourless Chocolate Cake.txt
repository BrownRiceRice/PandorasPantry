--------  ------------  --------------------------------
      12        ounces  bittersweet chocolate
       6        ounces  butter
   1 1/2        ounces  cocoa
      10         large  eggs -- separate out yolks
   4 1/2        ounces  granulated sugar
       1         sheet  parchment paper

Preheat your oven to 350 degrees.

Butter and cut parchment paper to fit a 10-inch cake pan that has straight sides. Take a 4-inch piece of parchment and wrap it around the inside of the pan, forming a collar. Butter and flour the pan.

Melt the chocolate and butter together, then add the cocoa. Set aside.

Whip whites and 4-1/2 ounces of sugar until it peaks easily. Add egg yolks to the chocolate mixture and then gently fold in the egg white mixture.

Pour mixture into the baking pan and bake in center of oven at 350 degrees for 40-45 minutes. Center should be slightly wet.

Take out of oven and remove parchment and invert onto a plate or 10-inch cake round.
Let cool before cutting. Do not refrigerate.
