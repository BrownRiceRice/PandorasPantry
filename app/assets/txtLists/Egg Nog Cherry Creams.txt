--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1           cup  egg nog
       2          cups  sugar
       2   tablespoons  white corn syrup
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
       2   tablespoons  butter
     1/2           cup  quartered red glazed cherries -- and/or green
     1/2           cup  minced pecans or walnuts

Combine the egg nog, sugar, corn syrup, and salt in a stainless steel or enamel saucepan.  The pan should hold at least 2 1/2 quarts to allow for boiling and beating.

Cook, stirring frequently to prevent scorching, until the mixture reaches the soft ball stage (about 235 degrees) and forms a soft ball when dropped into cold water.

At this point cool the sugar mixture to lukewarm, add the butter and begin beating.  This is an important step in the recipe.  If possible have someone to help with the beating because beating must be kept up until the candy loses its gloss (when it crystallizes).

Just as the candy begins to lose its gloss, stir in the cherries and nuts and spread into a buttered pie dish.  This must be done quickly or the candy will set in the pan.

Cool and cut into squares.
