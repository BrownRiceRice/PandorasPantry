       6                chiles -- (6 to 12)
       3           cup  cold water
       1       package  soy or textured vegetable protein -- (12oz)
       2   tablespoons  oil
       1        medium  onion -- chopped
       1         clove  garlic -- minced
       1    tablespoon  cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  red pepper
       1    tablespoon  paprika
      12           cup  water

Wash, stem and remove seeds from the chilies.  Put chilies in 3 cups cold water and bring to a boil.
After about 45 minutes to an hour the skins should slip off easily.  Mash the pulp into a paste.  If this
seems too difficult, you can substitute chili powder at the ratio of 1 tablespoon chili powder to a pod of
chili. Read the instructions on the soy or TVP package to see if the product was soaked beforehand.  If not, use some of the water to prepare this ingredient.  

Saute the onions in the olive oil until translucent.  Add the garlic and spices , then the 12 cups of water.  Bring to a boil, then add the nuggets.  Reduce to a simmer, cook for 30 minutes to an hour.  If this seems too runny, you can thicken with masa, the cornmeal flour used in tortillas.  When made in bulk, this chili can readily be frozen.
