       2                eggs
       2          cups  sugar
       1         pound  raisins
       2          cups  chopped nuts
       1         pound  graham cracker
     1/4         pound  butter
       1           cup  milk

Cream butter and sugar, add 1 egg at a time then add milk.  Now add crackers, mix well.  Add nuts and raisins.  Put in a tube cake pan.  Bake 2 1/2 hours at 250 to 300 degrees or until done. (I bake it at 275 degrees for 1 1/2 hours and 1 hour at 300 degrees) cake will be soft on top when it comes out, but will be hard when it cools.

Note:  You can use 1 pound vanilla wafers instead of graham crackers. (Dot Williams makes her's this way.)
