       2         pound  lean beef roast
       6                black peppercorns -- whole
       2           cup  cider vinegar
       2    tablespoon  salt
       2           cup  water
       2    tablespoon  sugar
       2            md  onions -- peeled sliced thin
     1/4           cup  flour -- for dredging
       1                lemon -- sliced thin
       6    tablespoon  flour
      10         whole  cloves
       2    tablespoon  cooking oil
       4                bay leaves
       6                gingersnaps

Place the meat in a deep bowl.Pour over it the vinegar and water.Add onions,lemon,cloves,bay leaves,peppercorns,salt and sugar.Cover and place in refrigerator for a minimum of two days,no longer than four.The longer it soaks,the stronger the taste.Turn meat at least once a day.. When ready to cook,remove meat from liquid and dust lightly with flour,using up to 1/4 cup.Heat oil in large pot or dutch oven.Brown meat on all sides.Strain marinade,removing and discarding solids,keeping only clear liquid.Add 1 cup marinade liquid to meat in pan,reserving remainder.Cover tightly and cook slowly,over low heat,for about 3 hours,until meat is fork tender.Add more marinade if necessary,to keep 1/2" of liquid in pan.. When meat is done,remove from the pan.Crush the gingersnaps and combine with the 6 tbs.flour.Blend with 2 cups reserved marinade liquid,then stir into liquid in pan and bring to boil.Cook,stirring until thickened.Serve hot,with meat.Meat is also good cold,sliced.Makes 4 to 6 servings..
