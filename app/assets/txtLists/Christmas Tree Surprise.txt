--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       3          cups  all-purpose flour
       2   tablespoons  sugar
       1       package  Fleischmann's. Active Dry or Rapid Rise
                        Yeast
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  milk
     1/4           cup  water
     1/4           cup  butter or margarine
       1                egg -- at room temperature
                        CHOCOLATE NUT FILLING
       1           cup  chocolate chips
     1/4           cup  chopped candied cherries
     1/4           cup  chopped pecans
     1/4           cup  chopped dates
                        Confectioners' Sugar Icing (recipe
                        follows)
                        Chocolate Icing (recipe follows)
                        Candied cherries -- optional

In large bowl, mix 1 cup flour, sugar, undissolved yeast and salt.
Heat milk, water and butter until hot to touch (125: to 130:F). Gradually add to dry ingredients; beat 2 minutes at medium speed of electric mixer, scraping bowl occasionally. Add egg and 1/2 cup flour; beat at high speed 2 minutes, scraping bowl occasionally. With spoon, stir in enough additional flour to make stiff dough. 
Knead on lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Place in greased bowl, turning to grease top. Cover; let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 50 minutes.*
Prepare Chocolate Nut Filling: In small bowl, combine chocolate chips, chopped candied cherries, chopped pecans and chopped dates.
Variation: Replace cherries in filling with additional 1/2 cup chopped pecans.
Punch dough down. Divide into 19 equal pieces. Flatten into 4-inch circles, making edges slightly thinner than centers. Place 1 tablespoon filling in center of each circle. Pull up edges and pinch to enclose filling. On lower third of greased baking sheet, arrange 5 buns in a row, seam-side down with edges touching. 
Build tree with additional rows of buns - 4 buns in second row, 3 buns in third row, 2 buns in fourth row and one for top of tree. 
To make trunk: arrange 2 rows of 2 buns each at bottom of tree. Cover; let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.
Bake at 375: for 15 to 20 minutes or until done. Remove from pan; cool on wire rack. Frost top with Confectioners' Sugar Icing. Drizzle with Chocolate Glaze. Decorate with candied cherries, if desired.
