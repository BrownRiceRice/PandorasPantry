       3        quarts  popped corn
       1       package  (10 1/2 ounces) miniature marshmallows
                        OR
       6          cups  miniature marshmallows
     1/2           cup  red cinnamon candies
     1/4           cup  butter
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        Red food coloring
       3          bars  (1 3/8 oz. each) milk chocolate
       1           Rib  bon
                        Pipe cleaners

Keep popped corn hot in warm oven. Measure marshmallows, cinnamon candies, butter and salt into heavy saucepan. Cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until marshmallows are melted. Tint pink with food coloring. Pour mixture over popcorn, stirring gently to coat.
Shape mixture into bells. A coffee cup may be used to form bell and a saucer to form bell's lip as follows. Lightly butter inside of cup to keep corn from sticking. (Also lightly butter hands to work with hot popcorn.)
Press mixture into cup to form bell and onto saucer to form bell's lip. Quickly place 1/2 milk chocolate bar between bell and lip and press together. When bell has set, use a metal skewer to make hole through center of lip and bell in order to insert pipe cleaner for clapper.
Ribbon may be attached to pipe cleaner ends on top of bells and arranged in different lengths for hanging if this is desired.
