       4          cups  onions, chopped
       1           cup  celery, chopped
       1           cup  bell pepper, chopped
       1           cup  fresh parsley, chopped
       1           cup  peanut cooking oil
       2   tablespoons  garlic, chopped
       3          cups  steak sauce
     1/2           cup  Louisiana hot sauce
       3          cups  ketchup
       3     teaspoons  salt
       1           cup  southern comfort liquor

In a large skillet, saute onions, celery, bell pepper and parsley in peanut oil until onions are clear or tender.  Add garlic and cook a little longer.  Add steak sauce, hot sauce, and ketchup. Salt to taste.  Add Southern Comfort.  Bring to a boil.  Lower heat and cover. Cook for 2 to 3 hours.  This sauce can be stored in the refrigerator for several weeks. Makes 3 quarts to 1 gallon. Justin says, "This is not to drink, no.  It's to use as a bubba-que sauce, but it also, too, is mighty fine for soppin."
