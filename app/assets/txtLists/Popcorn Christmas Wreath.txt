--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       4        quarts  unsalted popped popcorn
   1 1/2          cups  sugar
       1           cup  light corn syrup
     1/3           cup  butter or margarine
     1/3           cup  water
   1 1/2     teaspoons  salt
                        Colored hard candy balls
       1           Rib  bon bow -- if desired

Butter the surface of a 14-inch pizza pan or draw a wreath 14 inches in diameter and 4 to 5 inches wide on a sheet of heavy brown paper.
Place popcorn in a large, buttered bowl. Combine sugar, syrup, butter or margarine, water and salt in saucepan. Bring to boiling point over low heat, stirring until sugar melts. Continue cooking until syrup reaches the hard crack stage (290-295 degrees Fahrenheit).
Pour syrup in a fine stream over popcorn; stir just until popcorn is evenly coated. Pile unevenly around edge of buttered 14-inch pizza pan or wreath pattern, leaving a 7 1/2-inch hole in center to form a wreath.
Decorate with clusters of colored hard candy balls and ribbon bow, if desired.
