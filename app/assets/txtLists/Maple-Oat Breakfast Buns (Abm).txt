--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     2/3           cup  rice milk
       1                egg sub. equivalent for 1
                        egg
       1    tablespoon  applesauce (sub. for
                        b*tt*r)
       2          cups  bread flour
     1/3           cup  oat flour (process rolled
                        oats in food proc.)
       4     teaspoons  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
       1      teaspoon  yeast
     1/3           cup  maple syrup
     1/4           cup  brown sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/8      teaspoon  nutmeg
     1/2           cup  raisins -- (1/2 to 1)
     2/3           cup  rolled oats -- toasted in 350
                        oven for 10min. or until
                        light brown

Add the first 8 ingredients to bread machine according to manufacturer's  instructions.  Set it for the dough setting (mine calls it the manual cycle).  When cycle is complete, remove dough from machine.   Cover and let rise 10 min.  In a small saucepan, stir together the syrup, spices and brown sugar. Cook over low heat until sugar is dissolved, remove from heat and stir in raisins and toasted rolled oats. Set aside.

On a lightly floured surface, roll dough into a 12x8 rectangle.  Spread raisin mixture over dough to all edges.  Roll up jelly roll style, pinch seams to seal.  Cut into 1 inch slices.  Place rolls, cut sides down, on non stick cookie sheet. I gave my sheet a couple of spritzs with cooking spray and I think it helped. When the rolls come out, you need to use a spatula to pry them off the pan, because the brown sugar will have stuck, but they come right up. These had just the right amount of sweetness. Enjoy!
