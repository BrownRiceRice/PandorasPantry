--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  butter or margarine
                        --at room temperature
     1/2           cup  light brown sugar, packed
       2   tablespoons  granulated sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
       1         large  egg
       1      teaspoon  maple extract
       1      teaspoon  vanilla extract
   1 1/2          cups  all-purpose flour
     3/4           cup  pecans -- finely chopped
      24                pecan halves
                        powdered sugar

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  In a large bowl, combine the butter, sugars, baking powder, egg, maple extract and vanilla extract; beat with an electric mixer until fluffy, scraping the sides of the bowl several times.  With the mixer on low speed, gradually add the flour, beating just until blended.  Stir in the pecans.  Shape level measuring tablespoonfuls of dough into 1 1/4-inch balls.  Place 1 inch apart on ungreased cookie sheets.  Press a pecan half into the top of each ball.  Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the cookies look dry and the bottoms are lightly browned. Cool on the cookie sheets on wire racks for 1 to 2 minutes, then remove to racks to cool completely.  Store in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks.  Just before serving, dust with powdered sugar.  Penny Halsey (ATBN65B).
