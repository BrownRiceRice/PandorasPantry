--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       2        pounds  round steak
       2     teaspoons  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  ground black pepper
       1      teaspoon  ground red pepper
       1      teaspoon  ground white pepper
                        all-purpose flour (dredging)
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil
       3        medium  onions, chopped
       2                bell peppers, chopped
       1                celery rib, chopped
       1           cup  beef stock

Season the roast with one half of the salt and peppers.  Dust with flour on all sides.  Heat the oil in a Dutch oven or other large heavy pot over medium-high heat, add the steak, and brown well on all sides.  Remove the meat and pour off all but 1 teaspoon of the oil.  Add half the onions, bell peppers, celery, and the other half of the seasonings, and the stock or water.  Stir well and reduce the heat to the lowest possible point.  Return the roast to the pot and cover with the remaining vegetables.  Cover and let cook until the meat is very tender, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Serve the meat in slices, with rice alongside and the gravy over all. When you try this recipe with other kinds of meat, be sure to adjust the cooking times accordingly--let tenderness be your guide. For extra flavorful roasts, try larding with slivers of garlic before smothering.
