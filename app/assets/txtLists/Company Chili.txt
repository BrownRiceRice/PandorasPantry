       3        pounds  beef chuck or round steak
       2   tablespoons  cooking oil
       2                garlic coves -- minced
       4   tablespoons  chili powder
       2     teaspoons  ground cumin
       3   tablespoons  all purpose flour
       1    tablespoon  oregano
       3          cups  beef broth
     1/3      teaspoon  salt
       1          dash  ground pepper -- to taste
       1      15 ounce  ca  pinto or chili beans
       1       package  sour cream -- as needed
       2                lime -- as needed

ONE DAY IN ADVANCE: Cut the beef into 1-inch pieces. In a skillet heat oil to hot. Add beef.  Stir until color changes but does not brown. Lower heat, stir in garlic. Combine chili powder, cumin and flour. Sprinkle meat with chili mixture, stirring until meat is evenly coated. Crumble oregano over meat. Add 2 cups beef broth and stir until liquid is well blended. Add salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat; simmer partially covered over low heat for 1-1/2 hours. Add remaining broth and simmer 30 minutes longer. Meat should be almost falling apart. Cool well, refrigerate over night to "ripen" flavor. (This is most important.) Reheat on top of double-boiler.  Heat beans, drain, stir into chili. Serve on individual plates, adding a good dollop of sour cream. Squeeze lime juice over each portion. Cut the other lime into wedges and place a wedge onto each plate. Serve with hot corn bread and various fresh fruits.
