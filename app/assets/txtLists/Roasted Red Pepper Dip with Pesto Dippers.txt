--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       2         large  (12 ounces) red bell peppers
     1/4           cup  ricotta cheese
     1/4           cup  dairy sour cream
       1      teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
       1      teaspoon  fresh chives -- snipped
     1/2      teaspoon  fresh thyme -- chopped
     1/4      teaspoon  salt

                        PESTO DIPPERS
  3                     Bays English Muffins
  1              clove  garlic -- halved lengthwise
     1/4           cup  prepared pesto
  2        tablespoons  Romano or Parmesan cheese -- grated

Cut peppers lengthwise into quarters, discarding cores, seeds and ribs. Bring skin side up about 6 inches from heat until skin is blackened, 10 to 15 minutes. 

Remove from pan and wrap in aluminum foil. Let stand for 10 minutes. Remove skin. In food processor or blender, puree peppers with ricotta cheese until fairly smooth. 

Stir in sour cream, lemon juice, herbs and salt. Cover and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours to blend flavors. Serve with Pesto Dippers, carrot slices and celery sticks.

Pesto Dippers: Bake muffin halves in preheated 350 degree F oven for 10 to 12 minutes until crisp and golden brown at edges. Rub with cut side of garlic. 

Combine pesto and cheese, spread on muffins quarters. Serve as dippers with Red Roasted Pepper Dip.
