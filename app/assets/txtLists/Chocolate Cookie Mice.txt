   2 1/4          cups  all-purpose flour -- or unbleached
     1/4           cup  unsweetened cocoa powder

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  In a large bowl, beat the sugar, margarine and shortening until light and fluffy.  Add the vanilla extract and egg; blend well.  Lightly spoon flour into measuring cup; level off.  Stir in the flour, cocoa and baking powder; mix well.  Shape the dough into 1-inch balls.  To form a mouse, pinch one end of the ball to form the nose.  For the ears, make 2 tiny balls of dough and flatten slightly; gently press into the dough on the upper front of each mouse body.  For the eyes, press 2 miniature chocolate chips into the dough below the ears.  Place the shaped cookies 2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheets. Bake for 8 to 13 minutes, or until set.  For the tails, immediately place a piece of licorice into the rounded end of each cookie.  Remove from the cookie sheets.
