--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   2 1/2          cups  Unbleached Flour
     1/2           cup  Sugar
       2     teaspoons  Baking Powder
       1      teaspoon  Salt
     1/2      teaspoon  Ground Cinnamon
     3/4           cup  Milk
     1/4           cup  Vegetable Oil
       2         large  Eggs
   1 1/2          cups  Cooking Apples
       2          cups  Sharp Cheddar -- shredded
     3/4           cup  Walnuts OR Pecans -- chopped

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and grease and flour a 9 X 5-inch loaf pan. 
In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and cinnamon. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and add the milk, oil, and eggs. Stir until thoroughly combined. Gently stir in the chopped apples, cheddar cheese, and nuts. Bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes in the preheated oven until loaf is browned and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom. Cool in the pan on a rack for 5 minutes. Remove from the pan and cool to room temperature, on a wire rack, before slicing.
