   2 1/2        quarts  popped popcorn
   1 1/2           cup  light brown sugar
     3/4           cup  dark corn syrup
     1/2           cup  butter
       1    tablespoon  vinegar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
       1       package  (6 ounces) chocolate pieces
     1/2           cup  chopped walnuts
       2         pints  brick-style vanilla ice cream.

Keep popcorn warm. In a three-quart saucepan, combine brown sugar, corn syrup, butter, vinegar and salt. Cook and stir until sugar dissolves.
Continue to cook until hard ball stage (250 degrees Fahrenheit on candy thermometer). Pour syrup over popped popcorn; stir to coat.
Add chocolate pieces and nuts; stir just to mix. Pour into two 13 x 9 x 2 inch pans, spreading and packing firmly. Cool. In each pan, cut 12 rectangles. Cut each pint of ice cream into 6 slices. Sandwich ice cream between two popcorn rectangles.
