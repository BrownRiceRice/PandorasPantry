 Melt shortening in large Dutch oven (5 qt.) over medium high heat.

 Add tomato sauce, purred tomatoes and water; stir until smooth and boiling.  Cook 3 minutes or until thickened.

 Add all spices and seasoning, stirring well.

 Add thin-sliced okra and cook 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.

 Add cubed ham and continue cooking 10 minutes.

 Gumbo may be prepared in a day in advance and stored in refrigerator.

 Serve over scoops of fluffy white rice.

YIELD: 6 to 8 servings

NOTE:  Cleaned shrimp may be substituted for all or half of ham.
