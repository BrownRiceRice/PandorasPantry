       1           cup  graham cracker crumbs
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  margarine, melted
       1          env.  unflavored gelatin
     1/2           cup  cold water
       1           cup  sugar
       3         large  eggs, separated

Combine graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and margarine; press onto bottom of 9-inch springform pan. Soften gelatin in water, stir over low heat until dissolved.  Blend in 3/4 cup sugar and beaten egg yolks; cook stirring constantly, over low heat, 3 minutes.  Combine cream cheese and cocoa, mixing at medium speed on electric mixer until well blended.  Gradually add gelatin mixture and bourbon, mixing until well blended.  Chill until thickened, but not set. Beat egg whites until foamy; gradually adding the remaining sugar, beating until stiff peaks form.  Fold egg whites and whipped cream into cheese mixture and pour over crust.  Chill until firm.  Garnish with chocolate curls and small silver candy balls, if desired. VARIATION: Substitute 2 T cold coffee for bourbon.
