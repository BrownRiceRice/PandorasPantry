  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       8        ounces  queso fresco
       1           cup  whole kernel corn
       2          cups  cooked rice
       1           cup  chopped cooked shrimp
     1/2           cup  (2 ounces) Cheddar cheese
     1/4           cup  (1 ounce) Monterey Jack cheese
     1/4           cup  chopped onion
     1/4           cup  sour cream
       1      teaspoon  salt
      12                (2 to 3 ounces each) poblano peppers -- roasted and peeled
       2          cups  fresh bread crumbs
     1/2           cup  Parmesan cheese
       3   tablespoons  butter -- melted
       4                eggs
       1    tablespoon  water
       1           cup  flour

Combine queso fresco and corn in processor; process just until corn is no longer visible. Transfer cheese mixture to large bowl.

Add rice, shrimp, Cheddar cheese, Monterey Jack cheese, onion, sour cream, and salt. Set aside. Cut a small slit in one side of each poblano pepper and carefully remove seeds; leaving stems in tact. Pat peppers dry.

Stuff each pepper with approximately 1/4 cup of shrimp mixture. Secure with a wooden pick if necessary. Combine bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, and butter in medium bowl; stir until well blended. Set aside. Beat eggs with water in medium bowl.

Roll stuffed peppers in flour, dip in egg mixture, then coat with bread crumb mixture. Place in shallow baking dish allowing a little space between each pepper; bake at 350 degrees, 30 minutes or until golden brown and thoroughly heated. Serve immediately.
