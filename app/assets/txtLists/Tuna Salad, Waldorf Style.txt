Drain tuna.  Flake and combine with cucumbers, cubed apples and walnuts. Blend oil with vinegar and enough mayonnaise for a not too thick dressing. Pour over salad ingredients and toss lightly. If desired, make a garnish by cutting gherkins lengthwise into slices, leaving sliced fastened at the base.  Spread out like a fan. Cut a quarter of an apple into thin wedges and dip in lemon juice. Place wedges lengthwise between gherkins slices. Shrimp Salad Waldorf Style equally delicious. Use canned or quick-frozen deveined shrimp, chopped. Yield 6-8 servings. *Gherkins is a small prickly fruit that used for pickling or somewhat like a baby cucumber.
