--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  active starter
       1           cup  milk
   2 1/2          cups  flour
     1/3           cup  lard or shortening
       1    tablespoon  sugar
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
       2     teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  cream of tartar

At bedtime make a batter of the half cup of starter, cup of milk, and 1 cup of the flour.  Let set overnight if the biscuits are wanted for breakfast. If wanted for noon, the batter maybe mixed in the morning and set in a warm place to rise.  However, unless the weather is real warm, it is always all right to let it ferment overnight. It will get very light and bubbly. When ready to mix the biscuits, sift together the remaining cup and a half of flour and all other dry ingredients except the baking soda. Work in the lard or shortening with your fingers or a fork. Add baking soda dissolved in a little warm water to the sponge and then add the flour mixture. Mix into a soft dough. Knead lightly a few times to get in shape. Roll out to about 1/2 inch thickness or a little thicker,and cut with a biscuit cutter. Place close together in a 9 x 13-inch pan, turning to grease tops. Cover and set in a warm place to rise for about 45 minutes. Bake in a 375 degree oven for about 30 to 35 minutes. Leftovers are good split and toasted in a sandwich toaster.
