*Use Baker's style cottage cheese instead of ricotta if preferred. Crust: mix all crust ingredients and line the bottom and sides of a spring form pan, saving 1 cup mixture for topping. The recipe calls for 4-6 tablespoons melted margarine. You may not need the full amount to make a proper crust. Filling: Beat together the eggs and sugar. Add cheese and rest of ingredients; mix well. Pour carefully into lined pans. Top with remaining crumb topping. Bake in preheated 350 degree oven for 1 hour or until firm.
