   1 1/2         pound  top round or sirloin steak
       1          thin  strips
                        boneless
       1           cup  celery -- thinly sliced
       2    tablespoon  oil
     1/4           cup  onions -- thinly sliced
       1         clove  garlic -- minced
     1/2           cup  coca-cola
       1      teaspoon  salt
       2            md  tomatoes -- ripe
       1           cup  beef broth (bouillon)
   2 1/2    tablespoon  cornstarch
                        canned and undiluted
     1/4           cup  coca-cola
       1           cup  green bell pepper, cored
       1    tablespoon  soy sauce
                        seeded -- and cut into
                        rice -- cooked and hot

Trim all fat from the meat and cut into pencil-thin strips. In a deep skillet or Dutch oven, heat oil, garlic, and salt. Add the meat and brown over high heat, about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally with a fork. Add the beef broth. Cover and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the meat is fork-tender.

 Stir in the green pepper strips, celery, onions, and 1/2 cup of Coca-Cola. Cover and simmer for 5 minutes.  Do not overcooked; the vegetables should be tender-crisp.  Peel the tomatoes, cut into wedges, gently stir into meat.

 Blend cornstarch with the 1/4 cup of Coca-Cola and the soy sauce. Stir mixture into the meat and cook until sauce is thickens, about 1 minute, stirring lightly with a fork.  Serve over hot rice. Makes 6 (3/4 cup) servings. Recipe:  "International Cooking with Coca-Cola", a give-away pamphlet from The Coca-Cola Company, 1981
