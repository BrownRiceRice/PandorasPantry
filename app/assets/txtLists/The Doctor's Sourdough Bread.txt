--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1           cup  sourdough starter
       2          cups  warm water
       2          cups  warm milk
       1    tablespoon  butter
       1       package  active dry yeast
     1/4           cup  honey
       7          cups  unbleached flour
     1/4           cup  wheat germ
       2   tablespoons  sugar
       2     teaspoons  salt
       2     teaspoons  baking soda

Mix the starter and 2 1/2 Cups of the flour and all the water the night before you want to bake. Let stand in warm place overnight. Next morning mix in the butter with warm milk and stir in yeast until dissolved. Add honey and when thoroughly mixed, add 2 more cups of flour, and stir in the wheat germ. Sprinkle sugar, salt, and baking soda over the mixture. Gentlypress into dough and  mix lightly. Allow to stand from 30 to 50 minutes until mixture is bubbly. Add enough flour until the dough cleans the sides of the bowl. Then place the dough on a lightly floured board and knead 100 times or until silky mixture is developed. Form into 4 1-lb loaves, place in well-greased loaf pans 9 x 3 size. Let rise until double, about 2 to 3 hours in a warm room. Then bake in hot oven, 400 degrees F, for 20 minutes. Reduce oven temp. to 325 degrees F. and bake 20 minutes longer or until thoroughly baked. Remove from pans and place loaves on rack to cool.  Butter tops of loaves to prevent hard crustyness. Makes 4 1-lb loaves
