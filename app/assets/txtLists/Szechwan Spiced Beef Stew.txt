       1    tablespoon  ginger root -- minced
     1/4           cup  scallions -- chopped
       2        pounds  stew meat 1/4 inch chunks
       6   tablespoons  oil
       1    tablespoon  garlic -- minced
                        (include green part)
       3          cups  water
                        -----sauce-----
       5     teaspoons  szechwan chili bean sauce
       4   tablespoons  pale dry sherry
     1/2    tablespoon  peppercorns -- crushed
       4         whole  star anise
   2 1/2   tablespoons  szechwan sweet bean sauce
       4   tablespoons  black soy sauce
       2     teaspoons  sugar

COMBINE SAUCE INGREDIENTS, SET ASIDE. HEAT OIL IN A 4 TO 6 QUART POT. ADD GINGER, GARLIC, AND SCALLIONS, AND COOK FOR A FEW SECONDS. ADD BEEF AND COOK UNTIL MEAT LOSES ITS RED COLOR. STIR IN SAUCE AND MIX WELL. ADD 2 C. WATER, COVER, AND SIMMER FOR ABOUT AN HOUR. ADD REMAINING WATER AND COOK OVER LOW HEAT UNTIL BEEF IS TENDER, ABOUT ANOTHER HOUR. THERE SHOULD BE 1 1/2 CUPS OF SAUCE LEFT IN THE POT WHEN BEEF IS DONE. SERVE HOT!!! THE PREPARATION TIME IS THE WORSE PART, BUT ITS WORTH IT. MOST OF THE INGREDIENTS CAN BE FOUND AT A NEIGHBORHOOD ASIAN OR CHINESE STORE.
