       8        ounces  cream cheese -- softened
     1/4           cup  sugar
       1      teaspoon  vanilla
       1                egg
     1/2           cup  flaked coconut
       1           cup  semisweet chocolate pieces -- =or=- milk chocolate
                        -----glaze-----

       2     teaspoons  vanilla

Generously grease and lightly flour a 10" tube or Bundt pan. Prepare filling: set aside. In large mixer bowl, combine sugar, oil, and eggs; beat 1 minute at high speed. Add remaining ingredients except filling and nuts; beat 3 minutes at medium speed, scraping bowl occasionally. By hand, stir in nuts. Pour half of the batter in prepared pan. Carefully top with filling. Cover with remaining batter. Bake at 350: for 70-75 minutes, (cover with foil if it starts to get too brown) until top springs back when touched lightly in center. Cool upright in pan for 15 minutes; remove from pan. Cool completely. If desired, drizzle with glaze.

 FILLING: In small bowl, beat cream cheese, sugar, vanilla, and egg until smooth. Stir in coconut and chocolate pieces.
