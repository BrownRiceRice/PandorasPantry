Add mushrooms and saute 3 to 4 minutes or until tender.  Remove to platter with veal.

To pan add bouillon cube and 1 1/4 cups water.  Bring to boil, stirring to dissolve bouillon.

Add wine and boil 1 minute.

Stir together cornstarch and 1/4 cup water.  Gradually stir into hot liquid in skillet.  Stirring constantly, bring mixture to boil over medium heat and boil 1 minute.

Serve gravy over cutlets.
