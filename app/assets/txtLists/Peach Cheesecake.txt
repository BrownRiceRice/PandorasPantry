       1           cup  canned sliced peaches
                        drained

Pan: 9" springform pan Crust: In a medium-size bowl, combine the vanilla wafer crumbs, sugar, chopped pecans, and butter. Blend well with fingers, fork, or pastry blender. Press or pat the mixture onto the bottom and sides of a well-buttered springform pan. Chill in the freezer for 15 minutes. Filling: In a large bowl, beat the cottage cheese, sugar, and eggs until smooth. Add the vanilla and light cream and continue to beat until smooth and fairly thick. Gently fold in the crushed peaches. Pour the mixture into the chilled pan. Place the springform pan inside of a larger pan containing 1 inch of water and bake in a preheated 325 degree oven for 1-1/2 hours. Transfer the cake to a wire rack and allow to cool for 30 minutes. Topping: In a small mixing bowl, beat the sour cream and sugar until smooth. Spread the mixture evenly over the top of the cake and bake in a preheated 350 degree oven for 5 minutes. Transfer the cake to a wire rack and let cool completely. Remove the sides of the springform pan and decor ate the top of the cake with the sliced peaches. Refrigerate overnight. Remove the cake from the refrigerator 2 hours before serving. From: Dottie Cross TMPJ72B Reformatted for MM by CLM, HCPM52C
