     1/2           cup  butter or margarine -- softened
     1/3           cup  granulated sugar
       1                Egg yolk
                        Finely grated peel of 1 orange
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
       1           cup  flour
     1/2           cup  golden raisins
     1/2           cup  toasted shredded coconut

 Cream butter and sugar.  Beat in yolk, orange peel and salt.

 Mix in flour just to blend thoroughly.  Mix in raisins and coconut to distribute evenly.

 On lightly floured surface, roll into a 12" long.

 Wrap securely and refrigerate at least 1 hour and up to 1 week.

 With sharp knife, cut 1/3" thick slices, and place 1" apart on baking sheets.

 Bake in preheated 350 degree oven 15 to 20 minutes until cookies are set and bottoms are lightly browned.

 Remove to racks to cool completely.

 Decorate as desired with melted semi-sweet or white chocolate, and top with colored sprinkles, raisins, nuts, or candied fruit pieces.

 Allow to set before storing in layers between sheets of waxed paper in airtight container.
