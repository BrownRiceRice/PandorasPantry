1.  Do not reduce sugar or use sugar substitute.  The exact amounts of sugar, fruit and pectin are necessary for a good set.

2.  For recipes using less sugar, try SURE JELL Light Fruit Pectin.

3.  Buy new flat jar lids for good seal.

4.  Do not double recipes.  Mixture may not set.

5.  Use ripe fruit (not under or overripe) for best flavor.

6.  Crush berries 1 cup at a time, using potato masher.  With food processor, pulse to chop fruit; do not puree.  Jam has bits of fruit.

7.  Add 1/2 teaspoon butter or margarine to prevent foaming during cooking.

8. A full rolling boil is a boil that does not stop when stirred.
