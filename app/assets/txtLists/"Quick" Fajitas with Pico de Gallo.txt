--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1         pound  well-trimmed beef top round or top sirloin -- cut 3/4 inch thick
       8         small  flour tortillas
                        Lime wedges (optional)
                        Cilantro sprig (optional)
                        MARINADE
       2   tablespoons  fresh lime juice
       2     teaspoons  vegetable oil
       2         large  garlic cloves -- crushed
                        PICO DE GALLO
       1           cup  tomato -- seeded and chopped
     1/2           cup  zucchini -- diced
     1/4           cup  fresh cilantro -- chopped
     1/4           cup  prepared picante sauce or salsa
       1    tablespoon  fresh lime juice

Place beef steak in plastic bag; add marinade ingredients, turning to coat. Close bag securely and marinate in refrigerator 20 to 30 minutes, turning once.
Wrap tortillas securely in heavy-duty aluminum foil. Meanwhile in medium bowl, combine Pico de Gallo ingredients; mix well.

Remove steak from marinade; discard marinade. Place steak on grid over medium ash-covered coals. Grill top round steak, uncovered, 8 to 9 minutes (10 to 12 minutes for top sirloin steak) for medium-rare to medium doneness, turning occasionally. During last 5 minutes, place tortilla packet on outer edge of grid, turning occasionally.

Trim fat from steak; carve crosswise into very thin slices. Garnish with lime and cilantro, if desired.
