This traditional holiday cake gets its name because there is just about 1 cup of batter too much in this recipe and it you pour it all into your tube pan without using the collar, it will go over the top and all over your oven! Put eggs in mixing bowl of electric mixer and beat at medium speed. Add remaining ingredients, except nuts, in order: sugar, brown sugar, oil, honey, coffee, flour, baking soda, baking powder, vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and powdered cloves, while beating continuously. Fold nuts in last, reserving some to place on top. Make a 2 inch collar around the outside of a lightly oiled and floured tube pan and its inside circle. Pour in batter. Sprinkle remaining nuts on top. Bake at 335:, 45-55 minutes until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out dry. Allow to cool before removing from pan. You can also bake this cake in loaf pans cutting down on the baking time accordingly. Enjoy!
