--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       2        quarts  popped popcorn -- unsalted
   1 1/2          cups  light brown sugar -- firmly packed
     3/4           cup  light molasses
     1/2           cup  butter
       1    tablespoon  vinegar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        String licorice

Keep popcorn hot and crisp in a 300-degree Fahrenheit oven. Butter sides of a heavy 3-quart saucepan. In it, combine brown sugar, molasses, butter, vinegar and salt.
Bring to a boil, stirring until sugar dissolves. Clip candy thermometer to pan. Cook syrup to 250 degrees (hard-ball stage). Pour slowly over popcorn, stirring just to mix thoroughly. Butter hands lightly; quickly form popcorn balls into bell shape.
Or lightly butter a deep slant-sided mixing bowl and an 8-inch pie pan; pack with glazed popcorn. Unmold and press two parts of bell together.
To apply finishing touches: make loop from licorice strings and insert in top of bell. Heat a little corn syrup; brush on side of bell; press licorice strings in place to resemble the crack in the bell.
