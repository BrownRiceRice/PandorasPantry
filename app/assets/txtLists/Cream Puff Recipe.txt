--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1           Cup  Water
     1/2           Cup  Butter
     1/2      Teaspoon  Salt
       1           Cup  Flour
       4                Eggs

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

Bring water to a boil; add the salt and butter.  Break the butter up to speed melting.  It is important that as little as possible of the water boil away.

Dumb the flour into the boiling liquid and stir rapidly.  As soon as the mixture holds together and looks like corn meal mush, remove it from the heat.

Beat in the eggs, one at a time, until the mixture is smooth.

Droop by tablespoonfuls onto a shiny cookie sheet.  Allow room for expansion.

Bake at 425 degrees for 20 minutes.  Reduce heat to 325 degrees and bake for 20 minutes longer, or until golden and crisp.

Remove to cooling racks.  Make a slit in each puff or cut off the top to spread cooling and drying.
