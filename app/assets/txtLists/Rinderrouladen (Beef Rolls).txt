       1                onion; large -- chopped
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
   1 1/2           cup  beef broth -- hot
       4                peppercorns
     1/2                bay leaf

*    Sandwich or roll steaks should weigh about 6 oz each. **   Pickles, Salt Pork or Bacon should be cut into long thin strips. 

Lay steaks on a flat surface.  Spread each with mustard; sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Divide pickles, salt pork (or bacon), and onion among the steaks equally.  Roll up steaks jelly-roll fashion; secure with beef-roll clamps, toothpicks, or thread.  Heat oil in a heavy saucepan, add the steak roll, and brown well on all sides, about 15 minutes.  Pour in hot beef broth, peppercorns, and bay leaf.  Cover and simmer for 1 hour and 20 minutes.  Remove beef rolls, discard clamps, and arrange on a preheated platter.  Blend cornstarch with a small amount of cold water, stir into gravy and bring to a boil.  Boil until gravy is thick and bubbly.  Correct seasonings and serve separately.
