   1 1/2          cups  sugar
     3/4           cup  light molasses
     1/2           cup  water

Combine sugar, molasses, water and salt in a heavy saucepan. Place over medium heat and cook, stirring until sugar dissolves.
Wash sugar from sides of pan with a wet brush. Cook to 270 degrees Fahrenheit (soft-crack stage on a candy thermometer).

To assemble hat, place popcorn cone on a 12-inch black cardboard circle or a 12-inch plate. Decorate brim of hat with candy corn and licorice string tie.
Broomsticks: Make 1 recipe. Measure 1 cup of mixture to shape into each broom head. Insert wooden skewer for handle. Wrap with licorice string. Licorice strings also may be cut in 2 1/2-inch lengths and used for broom straws.
