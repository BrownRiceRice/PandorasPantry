--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       2          cups  cornmeal
                        ground cayenne pepper
       1           cup  plain flour
       2                eggs, beaten
       1      teaspoon  baking powder
       1           cup  buttermilk
       1      teaspoon  salt
       1           cup  green onion, finely chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  soda
       2   tablespoons  bacon drippings, hot
     1/2           cup  parsley, finely chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  garlic powder (to taste)
                        deep fat for frying

Combine all dry ingredients.  Add eggs, buttermilk, onions, and oil or bacon drippings.  Mix well.  Drop in deep hot fat by spoonfuls and brown on all sides. Now, I said above that this makes 48, I've never counted, so I don't know for sure.  But it sure does make a bunch. The main reason why I said 48 is because the program, MenuMaster, won't let you past that field unless you tell it something. Justin Wilson says, "Hush puppy is an old Southern term that originated after the Civil War.  People didn't have enough for themselves to eat let alone feed their dogs, so when the old hounds started barking from hunger, they would throw pieces of fried corn bread to them, yelling, 'Shut up, dog!  Hush puppy!"
