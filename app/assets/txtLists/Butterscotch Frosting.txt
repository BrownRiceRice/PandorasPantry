       2   tablespoons  granulated sugar
     1/4           cup  boiling water
   2 1/2          cups  confectioners sugar
     1/4           cup  milk

Make a caramel syrup of the granulated sugar by heating it slowly over a flame until it melts and becomes straw colored. Remove from fire. Add boiling water carefully as it splatters. Stir until sugar is dissolved.

Cream butter until soft. Add 1/2 cup confectioner's sugar. Then add sugar syrup, beating well. Add remaining confectioner's sugar gradually, thinning with milk to a spreading consistency.
