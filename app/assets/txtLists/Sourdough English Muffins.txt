--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  starter
       1    tablespoon  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
       1           cup  milk
   2 3/4          cups  flour
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
                        cornmeal

In large bowl combine starter,milk and 2 cups flour. Mix and cover. Let sit 8 hours at room temp. Mix 1/2 c of the flour,sugar,salt and soda together. Sprinkle over dough and mix to a very stiff dough. Add remaining 1/4 c flour and knead for 3 minutes. Roll out 3/4" thick and cut with a 3" round cutter or cup. Sprinkle lightly oiled cookie sheet with cornmeal. Place each muffin 1" apart. Sprinkle with cornmeal. Cover with towel for one hour. Bake at 200 for 8 min on each side in a lightly oiled,covered electric skillet. **** The actual recipe said to bake at 300 for 10 min on each side. Maybe my skillet is too hot. I made this recipe in my bread machine.
