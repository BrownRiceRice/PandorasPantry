       6                pork chops
       1                garlic clove -- minced
       1      teaspoon  caraway seeds -- crushed
       2      teaspoon  Hungarian paprika -- mild *
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        pepper -- as desired
       1           cup  white wine -- dry
       1           cup  sour cream (optional)

*  Use only Hungarian mild Paprika.  It is available at most larger stores and at specialty shops. 

Place the pork chops in an ovenproof casserole.  Mix the remaining ingredients, except sour cream, and pour over the chops.  Marinate the chops 2 to 3 hours in the refrigerator.  Bake the chops, uncovered, in the marinade in a preheated 325 degree F. oven for 1 hour or until tender. Add more wine if necessary.  Stir sour cream into pan juices and heat through but DO NOT boil.  Serve chops with sour-cream gravy and buttered noodles or dumplings.
