       2                egg whites
       1           cup  sugar
       1          dash  salt

Beat egg whites until frothy.  Slowly add sugar and salt.  Beat until quite thick.  Fold in almonds and almond extract.  Teaspoon onto a buttered and floured cookie sheet; let sit for 2 hours.  Then bake at 350 degrees until pale brown (about 12 minutes).  Very light!
