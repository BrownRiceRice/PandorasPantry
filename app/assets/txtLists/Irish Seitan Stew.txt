--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       2          cups  seitan -- diced
       1           cup  carrots -- roll-cut
       1           cup  parsnips -- roll-cut
       1           cup  onion -- diced
       1           cup  potatoes -- peeled and
                        diced
       2                bay leaves
     1/2      teaspoon  rosemary -- whole
     1/2      teaspoon  garlic -- minced
     1/2      teaspoon  basil
       1    tablespoon  parsley -- fresh
       2          cups  water
       5     teaspoons  tamari soy sauce
     1/2           cup  celery -- flaked
       4   tablespoons  water -- cold
       4   tablespoons  cornstarch

Put seitan, veggies (except celery), and herbs and spices in a large pot (Dutch oven or small stock pot will do).  Saute in a little water or veggie broth at medium heat for about 8 minutes, stirring to prevent burning. Add water and tamari and bring to a simmer. Cook about 10 more minutes or until veggies are soft.

 Add celery (add at end to help retain color and texture).

 Mix the 4 T cold water with the cornstarch.  Turn off heat under stew. Vigorously stir in cornstarch solution.  Turn heat back on under stew and stir until thickened.
