Let the frozen bread loaf rise once. Knead, reshape and place in a greased loaf pan. Let rise again. Make 2 slits in the top of the loaf to a depth equal to 1/3rd of the loaf. Divide and place the cherry pie filling in the slits. Let rise again to full size and brush the top of the loaf with melded butter and sprinkle with cinnamon sugar. Bake in a preheated 350~ oven for 35-40 minutes. Remove the loaf from the pan and cool. This bread can be served either warm or cold.
