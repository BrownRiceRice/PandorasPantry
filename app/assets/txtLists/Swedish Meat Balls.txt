       1                Egg -- slightly beaten

       1         pound  lean ground beef
     1/4         pound  ground veal -- or pork
                        SAUCE:
       2   tablespoons  butter or margarine
       3   tablespoons  flour
       1      teaspoon  sugar

       1           cup  water
     3/4           cup  light cream -- or evaporated milk

 Saut onion in butter.

 Combine egg with milk and bread crumbs; let stand 5 minutes.

 Add salt, spices, meat and onion.  Blend well.

 Melt remaining butter in large skillet.

 Using 2 teaspoons, form meat mixture into small balls about 1/2" in diameter.

 Drop some balls into skillet; brown well on all sides; remove to warm casserole; repeat until all meat balls are browned.

 To make sauce:  stir the flour, sugar, salt and pepper into the butter left in the skillet.

 Slowly add water and cream; cook and stir until thickened, about 5 minutes.

 Pour sauce over meat balls; cover and bake at 350 degrees 25 to 30 minutes.  Or simply return meat balls to skillet; cover and simmer until tender.

Yield:  about 36 meatballs.

NOTE: These meat balls may be made a day ahead, cooled and refrigerated.  Reheat just before serving.
