       8         ounce  cream cheese -- softened
       8         ounce  ricotta cheese
       8         ounce  cheddar cheese -- shredded
       1       package  taco seasoning mix
       8         ounce  sour cream -- can use light
       3                eggs
       1           can  green chilies, diced -- drained
     1/2           cup  red bell pepper -- diced
                        -----topping-----
     3/4           cup  salsa -- med. or hot
                        scallions -- chopped
                        parsley -- chopped

Beat cream cheese, ricotta and cheddar cheese with taco seasoning. Add sour cream. Beat in eggs one at a time, blending well after each addition. Fold in chilies and red pepper. Pour into greased 9-inch springform pan. Bake at 350~ for 50 minutes or until center of cake is firm. Cool on wire rack for 30 minutes. Refrigerate several hours or overnight. Just before serving spread salsa over top of cake and garnish with parsley and scallions. Serve with chips or crackers. Freezes well. **If you do not have ricotta, you can substitute an additional 8 oz. cream cheese. I have also topped this with William Sonoma's Geronimo peppers; (in addition to the toppings mentioned). Made for a very festive look. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find these anywhere else.
