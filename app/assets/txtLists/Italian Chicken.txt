       2         pound  chicken; breasts, thighs -- a
       8         ounce  italian dressing -- ( i used
  14 1/2         ounce  tomato wedges -- drained
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
       6         ounce  mushrooms -- sliced drained

       8         ounce  linguine
      14         ounce  artichoke hearts -- drained a

Place chicken in a lightly greased 12x8x2" baking dish (Pam works great). Arrange tomatoes, mushrooms, olives, and artichokes on top. Combine salad dressing and wine; pour over vegetables and chicken. Sprinkle with the onion soup mix.  Cover and bake @ 350 for 1 hr.or until the chicken is done.  Meanwhile cook the linguine. When the chicken is done, spoon the juice and vegetables over the pasta and top with the chicken. ( Southern Living, Sept. 1991) I bet this would be great made ahead and letting the chicken marinade in the dressing and wine. It was good and good for you. Hope you enjoy.
