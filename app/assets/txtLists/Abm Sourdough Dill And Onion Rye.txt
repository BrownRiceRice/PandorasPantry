--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1      teaspoon  red star yeast
   2 1/3          cups  bread flour
     1/4           cup  rye flour
       1    tablespoon  lecithin granules
       1    tablespoon  gluten
       1      teaspoon  salt
       1      teaspoon  dill weed (dried)
       1      teaspoon  dried onion flakes
     1/2           cup  water
       1           cup  sourdough starter*

I just realized that I never added any sugar or dry milk. It doesn't seem to miss them.  Next time I'll add more dill and onion. The jars were almost empty when my baking fit struck me, so I went with what I had.

 I baked it on the regular bake cycle.  It rose almost to the top of the pan and is a lovely golden color. Tastes pretty good, too.

 *Starter:  2c all purpose flour, 2 c warm water, 1 pk yeast. Combined and left in oven all night with the light on. It doesn't have a name yet. Would "Bubbles" be too optimistic?
