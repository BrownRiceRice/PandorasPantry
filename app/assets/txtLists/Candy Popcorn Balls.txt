       5          cups  popped popcorn
       2         large  marshmallows -- cut up
       1           cup  powdered sugar
       3   tablespoons  light corn syrup
       1    tablespoon  butter or margarine
   1 1/2     teaspoons  water
     1/3           cup  gumdrops -- snipped

Place popcorn in large bowl. In medium saucepan combine marshmallows, sugar, corn syrup, butter, and water. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat; continue stirring until marshmallows are melted. Pour syrup over popcorn, toss lightly until well coated. Let mixture stand until cool enough to handle. Grease hands, then shape popcorn into lemon size balls and press several gumdrop pieces into each. Wrap each ball in saran; store at room temperature. Makes 1 dozen balls.
