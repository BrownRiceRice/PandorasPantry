       4   tablespoons  butter or margarine
       1         large  tomato -- peel and center
       1      teaspoon  dried oregano -- crumbled
     1/2           cup  white wine
       1         pound  feta cheese -- crumbled

*Use 2-3 cloves if you like the flavor or garlic. Pour lemon juice over cleaned shrimp in bowl and set aside. In a skillet saute onions, garlic, celery, parsley and chopped tomatoes in olive oil until onions and celery are tender.  Reduce heat and simmer for about 20 minutes. Add clam juice, cook for another 5 minutes and remove from heat. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. In another pan saute shrimp in butter until they are pink. Pour tomato mixture into bottom of a casserole. Place whole peeled tomato in center and surround with shrimp. Sprinkle entire casserole with oregano. Pour white wine around shrimp and sprinkle feta cheese over them and into tomato center.  Bake in an oven preheated to 400 degrees for 15 minutes or until feta melts.  To serve, remove shrimp carefully with spatula so that melted feta stays intact. Quarter tomato and serve as a garnish.
