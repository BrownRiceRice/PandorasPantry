I used the whole wheat starter and experimented with your whole wheat bread recipe in the DAK today. It turned out great. Basically, I just halved your recipe and added a few things. My DAK is a 3 cup flour model, is yours? If I'm using whole wheat or rye flour, I can add more flour because it doesn't rise as much.  Also, whenever I use whole wheat, etc. I add vital wheat gluten and lecithin to aid elasticity and to help it rise. This is what I put in the DAK and the order I used: Turn the light/dark setting to 12 o'clock and set the menu to Sweet Bread (the auto. one, not the manual one) Later, at the beeps, I added 3/4 c. pecans (didn't have walnuts on hand). I usually add large pieces since they are kind of cut up by the B/M while knead ing. We can keep experimenting with this....let me know if you try it and what you add or subtract. Have you ever added raisins, oatmeal or any kind of seeds? The B/M gives me the lazy way out, and I wanted to see what it would do in it.  Thanks so much for taking precious  time to post the recipe. P.S. I have some of the beer s/d starter to give you when we get together, but the whole wheat starter is GREAT!. Regards, 08/21 11:14 P.M. JUDY/NC PJXG05A
