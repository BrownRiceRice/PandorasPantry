--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1           cup  milk
       1           cup  unbleached flour

Let milk stand for a day or so in an uncovered container at room temperature.  Add flour to milk and let stand for another couple of days. When it starts working well and smells right, it is ready to use. NOTE: All containers for starters not using yeast, must be carefully scalded before use.  If you are carless or do not scald them the starter will fail.
