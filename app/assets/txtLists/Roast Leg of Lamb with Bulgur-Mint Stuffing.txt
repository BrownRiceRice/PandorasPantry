--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1           cup  bulgur
       2   tablespoons  butter
       1         large  onion -- minced
       1      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2           cup  coarsely chopped walnuts -- toasted
       3   tablespoons  minced mint
       1    tablespoon  lemon juice
                        Salt
                        Ground black pepper
       7        pounds  leg of lamb -- aitch and thigh bone

TO PREPARE: For the stuffing, bring bulgur and 3 cups water to boil in a medium saucepan. Cover and simmer until bulgur is tender, about 25 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand 10 minutes. Drain bulgur and transfer to a medium bowl.

Heat butter in a skillet. Add onions; sauti until softened, about 3 minutes. Add onions, cinnamon, walnuts, mint, lemon juice, 3/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper to the bulgur; toss. (Can be cooled, covered, and refrigerated overnight.)

Sprinkle 1/2 tablespoon salt and 1/2 tablespoon pepper all over the leg of lamb. Spoon the Bulgar-Mint Stuffing into the lamb cavity. Fold the flap of meat over the stuffed cavity, completely enclosing the stuffing. Use a trussing needle and twine to sew the cavity shut. Starting at the shank end, wrap lengths of twine crosswise at 1-inch intervals around the stuffed leg of lamb, tying each length of twine in a knot to secure.

TO COOK: Heat oven to 400:F. Transfer stuffed leg of lamb to a roasting pan; roast until a meat thermometer inserted into the center of the stuffed lamb registers 130:F, about 45 minutes. Transfer lamb to a carving board; let stand 10 minutes.

TO SERVE: Remove twine; cut roast crosswise into 1/2-inch thick slices. Serve immediately.
