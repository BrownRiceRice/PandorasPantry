       1           cup  butter -- softened
       2          cups  sugar
       3                eggs,large
       3          cups  flour,all-purpose -- sifted
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
       1           cup  buttermilk
       2   tablespoons  lemon peel,grated
       2   tablespoons  lemon juice,fresh
                        lemon icing:
     1/4           cup  butter -- softened
       2          cups  powdered sugar
   1 1/2   tablespoons  lemon peel,grated
     1/4           cup  lemon juice,fresh

Preheat oven to 325 degrees. In a very large bowl, cream butter (or margarine) until very light; slowly add sugar until mixture is very light and fluffy. Beat in eggs one at a time. In another bowl, sift flour, baking soda and salt together. Add flour mixture alternately with buttermilk to butter mixture. Begin and end with flour. Mix in lemon peel and juice. Pour batter into greased and floured 10-inch tube or 12-inch bundt pan. Bake for 65-75 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Place pan on rack for 10 minutes to cool. Turn cake out of pan onto rack. Spread with as much lemon icing as the cake can absorb (about a third of the icing) Allow cake to cool completely then frost with remaining icing. ICING: Blend butter and sugar together in a medium bowl. Mix in peel and juice, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the frosting is of spreading consistency. If the entire amount of juice is used,  the icing will be thin and possibly difficult to spread evenly, however a very tangy frosting greatly enhances the flavor of the cake. This cake was a second place winner at the Del Mar fair. Jo Anne Merrill
