--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1       package  vanilla pudding
       2     teaspoons  unflavored gelatin
       2          cups  egg nog
     1/2      teaspoon  rum extract
     1/2          pint  whipping cream
       9             "  baked pie shell

 Combine pudding mix and gelatin in a saucepan.  Blend in egg nog and cook on low heat or over boiling water, stirring, until thickened and bubbly.

 Remove from heat and stir in rum extract.

 Chill in refrigerator, stirring frequently to prevent a "skin" from forming on top.

 Whip cream until stiff.  Beat egg nog mixture until smooth (an electric mixer speeds this process) and fold in whipped cream.

 Pour into baked pie shell and chill several hours until set.

 Garnish with chocolate shavings, glazed fruit, whipped cream or nutmeg.

VARIATION:  CHOCOLATE EGG NOG PIE:  Substitute chocolate pudding mix for vanilla pudding.

Serves: 6 - 8.
