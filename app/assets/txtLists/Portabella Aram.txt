--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1         large  tortilla wrap (any flavor)
     3/4           cup  Gorgonzola (enough to cover entire tortilla)
      12                washed and dried spinach leaves
       6   thin slices  sauteed egg plant
       1         large  portabella mushroom -- sliced thinly and sauteed
     1/4                red pepper -- cut into strips and sauteed
       1    tablespoon  olive oil

Put the gorgonzola on the wrap and warm it until the cheese can be easily spread over the entire wrap. Place the spinach leaves flat on the cheese, covering the whole wrap.

Do the same with the eggplant slices. Add the portabella and red peppers and then roll very tightly. For sharing, slice into rounds.
