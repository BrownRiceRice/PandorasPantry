     1/4           cup  cream cheese -- softened
       2   tablespoons  powdered sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  grated orange peel
       8        slices  French bread -- 1/2-inch slices
       8   tablespoons  jam (any flavor)
       4                eggs
     1/2           cup  whole milk
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla
                        Nonstick spray

Combine cream cheese, powdered sugar and orange peel. Spread evenly on 4 slices of French bread.

On each of the remaining slices, spread 2 teaspoons of jam. Make a "sandwich" from the bread topped with the cream cheese mixture and the ones topped with jam.

Combine eggs, milk and vanilla. Lightly spray a skillet with nonstick spray; heat until hot. Dip sandwiches into egg mixture (coat both sides). Cook in skillet until golden brown. Top with 2 teaspoons jam and serve.
