     1/4         Pound  Salt Pork
   1 1/2        Pounds  Fresh Black-Eyed Peas
                        Cold Water
       1      Teaspoon  Bacon Grease
       1      Teaspoon  Sugar
       1      Teaspoon  Salt -- or to taste
       1                Onion -- cut in quarters
     1/4                Hot Peppers -- optional

Cut slits in washed and dried salt pork.

In medium sized saucepan cover meat with about a quart of cold water.  Boil, covered, until meat is tender and water has evaporated down to about a cupful.  Add another quart of cold water to the meat.

Add peas, bacon grease, sugar, onion and hot pepper.  Bring to a boil, cover again and lower fire to medium low.

When peas have become slightly tender - about 30 minutes - add salt.

Continue cooking until tender and tasty, usually about 20 minutes.
