       4          cups  onions, finely chopped
       1           cup  celery, finely chopped
       1           cup  bell pepper, finely chopped
       1           cup  parsley, finely chopped
       1           cup  peanut oil
       1    tablespoon  garlic, finely chopped
       3          cups  steak sauce
     1/2           cup  Louisiana hot sauce or
       3          cups  ketchup
       2   tablespoons  cayenne pepper
       3     teaspoons  salt, to taste
       1           cup  southern comfort liquor
       1         pound  andouille sausage

Saute onions, celery, bell pepper, and parsley in peanut oil until the onions are clear or tender.  Add garlic and cook a little longer.  Add steak sauce, hot sauce, and ketchup.  Add salt to taste.  Add Southern Comfort.  Bring to a boil.  Lower heat and cook for 2 to 3 hours. Makes about 3/4 gallon.  This will keep in the refrigerator for weeks. Slice 1 lb. andouille or smoked sausage 1/4 inch thick and combine with 1 cup sauce.  Heat well on stove or in a chafing dish.  Serve with small pieces of French bread or use toothpicks to spear andouille.  You will need plenty of napkins, also, too. "Other smoked sausages may be used, but we like andouille."
