Early in the day: 1.  In a medium bowl, combine flour, 6 tablespoons sugar, and 1 teaspoon grated lemon peel. With pastry blender or two knives used scissor fashion, cut in butter or margarine until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  With a fork, stir in 2 egg yolks and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla to form a very stiff dough. Chill 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 425 degrees, F. 2. Press one third of the chilled dough evenly into the bottom of a 9 inch springform pan. Bake 8 - 10 minutes until golden brown. Cool. Press rest of dough around sides of pan to within 1 inch of top. Do not bake. 3. In a large bowl, with mixer at high speed, beat cream cheese until smooth' gradually add Cheddar cheese, beating until well blended - about 5 minutes. Occasionally scrape bowl with rubber spatula. 4. At medium speed, gradually beat in 1/2 teaspoon grated lemon peel, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla, 1 3/4 cups sugar, 2 egg yolks, and remaining ingredients until blended. Beat 5 minutes, occasionally scraping bowl. 5. Pour mixture into crust. Bake 10 minutes. Turn oven control to 300F and bake 1 hour and 15 minutes longer or until top is firm when lightly pressed with a finger. 6. Cool in pan on wire rack. Cake will sink in center, leaving cracks around crust. With spatula, loosen pan side and remove. Loosen cake from pan bottom; slide onto plate; chill. Makes about 12 servings.
