     1/2      teaspoon  mint -- chopped
       2                hard cooked eggs
       3        pounds  leg of lamb
       1           cup  butter
       1    tablespoon  tomato paste + 1 c. water
                        salt & pepper to taste

       2                eggs -- lightly beaten
     3/4         pound  phyllo

Chop onion and rinse it in strainer under running water; drain. Mix garlic with parsley and min.  Slice eggs thinly. Cut lamb from bone, then cut into very small pcs. (a little coarser than ground beef). Lightly brown the lamb with the onions in 1/3 of the butter. Add tomato paste, salt & pepper, garlic, parsley, and mint, and mix well. Simmer for abt. 30 min. Remove from heat.  Add cheese and lightly beaten eggs and mix again. Melt reamining butter.

 Butter a baking pan abt. 2" smaller that the phyllo sheets. Use 9 phyllo sheets for the bottom, buttering each well before laying in pan. Do not tim them.  Pour meat mixture over the phyllo, spreading it evenly. Place sliced eggs on top of the meat.  Fold the overhanging edges of the phyllo sheets onto the filling. Butter them well. Add remaining sheets to form top crust, again buttering each sheet before using it. Score top lightly with sharp, pointed knife into serving-size pcs. Pour on any remaining butter. Bake in preheated 300 F. oven for abt. 1 hr.  Let cool for 30 min.; cut through, and serve.  Serves 8 to 10.
