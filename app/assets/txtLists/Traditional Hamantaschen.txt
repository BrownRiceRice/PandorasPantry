--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1      envelope  dry yeast
     1/4           cup  milk -- lukewarm
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  butter
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
       1           cup  milk -- scalded
       2                eggs -- slightly beaten
       4          cups  all-purpose flour
       1                egg yolk

Dissolve the yeast in the 1/4 cup of lukewarm milk, making certain that the milk is not too warm.  Stir in 1 tablespoon of sugar and set aside.  In a deep mixing bowl, combine the butter, remaining sugar, salt and scalded milk, and stir until all are blended.  When lukewarm, stir in the yeast.  Add the eggs and about 2 cups of the flour, and beat to a smooth batter.  Add remaining flour to make a tender dough.  Turn out on a floured board and knead for about 2 minutes.  Grease a large mixing bowl; grease whole surface of the large ball of dough and place dough in bowl.  Cover.  Let rise in a warm, not hot, place, to double its bulk. (Takes from 2 to 4 hours.)  Again knead on a floured board for about a minute.  Roll out 1/8 of an inch thick.  Cut into 3- to 4-inch circles.

Place filling on each.  Recipe for Mohn Filling follow.  To shape true hamantaschen, pinch edges of a circle together over filling, leaving about 1/2 open, forming a cornucopia.  Then fold over the flap and pinch these edges firmly together.  Arrange well apart on a greased cookie sheet.  Cover with a cloth and let rise again in a warm place to double in bulk.  Brush tops with the egg yolk, thinned with a little water.  Bake in a moderate oven (350F) for 15 to 20 minutes.  Makes 2 to 2 1/2 dozen.
