Place whole heads of garlic, prepared as for Roasted Garlic, on a sheet of heavy-duty foil. Top with butter (4 tablespoons per 8 Heads) and a few sprigs of fresh rosemary or oregano. If fresh herbs are unavailable, substitute dried (2 teaspoons of dried herbs for 8 heads of garlic). Fold the foil over the garlic and seal the package well. Cook over hot coals for about 45 minutes, turning the package occasionally with tongs.
