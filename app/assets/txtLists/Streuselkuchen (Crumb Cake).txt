   2 1/4          cups  flour; unbleached, unsifted
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt

       1                egg; large

OPPING: For topping, mix sugars, cinnamon and flour.  Cut in butter until mixture is crumbly. CAKE: To make cake, mix 1 cup flour, sugar, salt and yeast in a large bowl. Place milk and butter in a sauce pan and heat until very warm (120 to 130 degrees F).  Gradually add to dry ingredients; beat 2 minutes.  Beat in egg and 1 cup flour.  Beat on high speed for 2 minutes.  Stir in enough flour to make a soft but stiff batter.  Spread batter into a well-greased 9-inch square cake pan.  Sprinkle with topping.  Let rise in a warm place until double in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours.  Bake at 350 degrees F. about 45 minutes or until done. Makes 1 9-inch square cake.
