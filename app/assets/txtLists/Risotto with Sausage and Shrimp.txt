     1/2         pound  medium shrimp -- peeled and deveined
       3   tablespoons  butter or margarine -- divided
     1/2           cup  chopped onion
       1           cup  uncooked rice
     1/3           cup  dry white wine
       2          cups  chicken broth
     1/4           cup  grated Parmesan cheese

Cook sausage in large skillet over medium heat. Remove from skillet; drain on paper towels. Set aside. Cook shrimp in 2 tablespoons butter until it turns pink. Remove from skillet; set aside. It will take approximately 25 to 30 minutes.

Cook onion until soft in remaining 1 tablespoon butter. Add rice and stir 2 to 3 minutes. Add wine; stir until absorbed. Increase heat to medium high; stir in 1 cup broth. Cook, uncovered, stirring frequently, until broth is absorbed.

Continue stirring and adding remaining 1 cup broth and 3 cups water, allowing each cup to be absorbed before adding another, until rice is tender and mixture has a creamy consistency.

Stir in cheese, pepper, cream, and reserved sausage and shrimp. Stir until mixture is creamy, about 2 to 3 minutes. Serve immediately.
