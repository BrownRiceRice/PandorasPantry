                        flour -- for thickening
                        liquid
       4                carrots -- peel, cut into piece
                        oil -- for saute
                        salt and pepper -- to taste
       1      teaspoon  dried oregano
       1      teaspoon  dried rosemary
                        dry white wine -- to your taste

Wash them chickens feet, scrub between toes to remove "toe-jam".  Rinse in clear water.  Wash and de-fat chicken breasts, remove skin and bones. Cut into small pieces. Pat dry with paper towels, and saute in hot oil or butter for a few minutes.  Add vegetables and spices, saute a few minutes more. Stir, make onions soft but not browned. Add a little wine, cook over low heat for a few minutes while you drink a cup of the wine and some of the liquid  evaporates, do not cover skillet.  Boil water, add bouillon and dissolve (the bouillon). Throw in the whole mess from the skillet, all meat and vegetables, toss in the feet, bring to a boil and then simmer until the chicken is cooked and tender.  Have another cup of wine.  In a clean skillet heat some oil, add some flour, equal measure maybe 1/4 cup, each, over moderate heat, make a "roux,"  browning the flour/oil mixture, but do not burn, add to the soup.  Cook the whole thing until slightly thickened, remove from heat, add the rest of the wine, cover, let set a few minutes, and serve with cooked rice (maybe add cooked rice to the soup, or separately)  Open a second bottle of wine to serve with the soup.
