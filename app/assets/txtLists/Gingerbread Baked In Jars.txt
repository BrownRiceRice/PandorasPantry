--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1           cup  all-purpose flour
     3/4           cup  granulated sugar
       1      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
       2     teaspoons  ground ginger
       1      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cloves
     3/4           cup  margarine -- softened
     3/4           cup  water
     1/2           cup  molasses

Preheat oven to 325-degrees (NO higher).

Sterilize 5 (12 oz) Ball Quilted Crystal (#14400-81400)jam/jelly canning jars, lids and rings by boiling them for 15 minutes. Remove the jars from the water and allow them to air-dry on your counter top; leave the lids and rings in the hot water until you're ready to use them.

Once the jars are cool enough to handle, use a pastry brush to grease them with shortening (DO NOT use butter, margarine, PAM or Baker's Secret); set aside.

In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, salt, ginger, cinnamon and cloves. Stir in margarine, water and molasses until well blended. Divide batter among the 5 jars (they should be about 1/2 full). Place jars onto a cookie sheet or they'll tip over.

Bake in preheated 325-degree oven for 35 minutes or until cake tester inserted in center comes out clean. Move the jars around in the oven while they're baking, so they'll bake evenly.

Have your HOT lids ready. Using HEAVY-DUTY MITTS (the jars ARE HOT!) Take one jar at a time from the oven and place a lid on, then the ring. Tightly screw on lids--do it FAST because the lid gets REAL hot!  Allow jars to cool on your countertop.

Once the jars are cool, decorate with round pieces of cloth. Unscrew the ring (the lid should be sealed by now) and place a few cotton balls or a wad of batting on top of the lid (makes it poof-y on top), then a piece of cloth (about 3" larger than the lid) on top and screw the ring back on. Decorate as desired. I used pinking shears to cut the cloth rounds out, otherwise some material will start to unravel. A hot glue gun is INVALUABLE--glue on dried flowers, bows, ribbons, etc. Got any questions....gimme a yell!
