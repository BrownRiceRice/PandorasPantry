       3         quart  water
       6                eggs -- well beaten
       9                chicken bouillon cubes
   1 1/2           cup  finely chopped green onions
     1/3           cup  soy sauce
                        and tops

Bring water to a boil in a large saucepan; add bouillon cubes and stir until dissolved.  Stir in soy sauce; return to a boil.  Remove from heat; add eggs all at once, stirring rapidly in one direction with a spoon. Eggs will separate to form fine threads.  Stir in green onions.  Serve immediately.
