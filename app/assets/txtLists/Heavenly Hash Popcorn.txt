--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  butter
       1           cup  chocolate chips
       1           cup  pecans -- toasted
       6          cups  popcorn -- popped
       4          cups  miniature marshmallows

In a heavy saucepan, put the butter, chocolate and pecans. Cook over a moderate heat until melted, stirring frequently to prevent burning. Pour over the popped corn and marshmallows. Stir well. Spread on a buttered cookie sheet and refrigerate to cool.

For variations, you may wish to substitute butterscotch morsels or use bitter chocolate. White chocolate pieces in place of chips make a pretty white candy which can be colored and molded into shaped cake pans. Yogurt candy coating can also be used for a more piquant flavor.
