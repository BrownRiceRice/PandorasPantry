     1/4           cup  butter; softened
       1           cup  sugar
       2                egg yolks; large, beaten
       1                egg; large, whole, beaten
       4          cups  flour; unbleached
       2     teaspoons  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  nutmeg
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     3/4           cup  butter
                        confectioners' sugar

Cream the butter and sugar.  Stir in egg yolks and whole egg; blend. In a separate bowl, sift all dry ingredients except the confectioners' sugar; add to creamed mixture, alternating with buttermilk.  Stir to mix all ingredients.  Cook by dropping spoonfuls of dough into 375 degree F deep fat.  Fry a few at a time, to keep fat temperature constant.  Turn to brown on all sides.  Drain on paper towels; sprinkle with confectioners' sugar.
