                        Sugar
                        Salt

 3.  Peel and core pears; cut into 1/4 inch thick slices.  In medium bowl, toss pear slices with currants, lemon juice, cinnamon, 3 Tbsp. sugar and 1 TB. flour.  Set aside.

 4.  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  On well floured large cookie sheet with floured rolling pin, roll dough into 10" round.  With spatula, loosen round from cookie sheet.  Mound pear mixture in center of dough round; fold dough up around pears, leaving a 2 1/2" opening in center.  Brush crust with milk; sprinkle with 2 Tsp. sugar.

 5.  Bake tart 20 minutes.  Mix chopped pecans with 1 Tbsp. sugar; sprinkle opening in center with pecan mixture.  Bake tart 10 minutes longer or until crust is browned.

 6.  Cool tart on cookie sheet on wire rack 10 minutes.  Serve tart warm, or cool tart completely to serve later.
