       1           cup  berries, fresh (blueberries, blackberries
                        or raspberries)
   1 3/4          cups  flour -- sifted
       2     teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/3           cup  margarine -- nondairy
     2/3           cup  sugar
                        egg substitute equal to 2 eggs
       1                banana, ripe -- mashed

Wash berries gently; drain and sprinkle 2 tablespoons of flour on them and toss lightly. Sift together remaining flour, baking powder, salt and baking soda. Beat margarine in to cream it. Gradually add sugar and continue beating until light and fluffy. Beat in egg substitute, a little at a time. Add banana in 3 parts. Fold in the berries carefully.

 Spoon batter into a 9 x 5 x 3-inch greased loaf pan; bake at 350 degrees for 50 minutes or until done.
