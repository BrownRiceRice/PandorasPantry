--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1           cup  raw oysters
     1/4           cup  flour
     1/2         pound  raw shrimp -- shelled and deveined
       2   tablespoons  peanut, vegetable or corn oil
       1         piece  (2-inch) fresh ginger root -- peeled and cut into
       5                scallions -- trimmed and cut in 2
       1      teaspoon  light soy sauce
       1      teaspoon  sesame oil
                        Salt and freshly ground black
                        Pepper -- to taste
   1 1/2   tablespoons  cornstarch
   1 1/2   tablespoons  cold water

Place oysters in mixing bowl; add flour and enough water to cover. Stir oysters in the liquid. Drain well, run under several changes of cold water and drain well again. (Flour will cleanse and plump oysters.) Prepare shrimp; set aside.

Drop oysters into barely simmering water. Turn off heat. Let stand 1 minute; drain. Set aside. Repeat with shrimp. Heat oil in wok or skillet over high heat. Add ginger and scallions. Cook, stirring, 5 seconds.

Add soy sauce, sesame oil, salt and pepper to taste, stirring constantly. Blend cornstarch into cold water; stir into the wok or skillet. Cook 10 seconds. Serve at once.
