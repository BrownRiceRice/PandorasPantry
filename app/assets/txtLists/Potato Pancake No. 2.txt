Peel potatoes, wash with cold water and drain. Grate at once and drain off water that collects. Mix potatoes, onion, flour, bacon bits, eggs and seasonings, blending well. Heat butter in skillet. Just before butter browns, drop in 1/3 cup batter and flatten out. When golden brown on one side, turn pancakes over and cook till crisp and brown on other side. Should make approx. 12 pancakes. Best served with sour cream.
