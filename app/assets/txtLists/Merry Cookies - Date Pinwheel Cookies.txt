  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4                Basic dough
     1/3           cup  cut-up dates
       3   tablespoons  finely chopped nuts
       3   tablespoons  brown sugar -- packed
       2   tablespoons  water
     1/4      teaspoon  grated orange peel

 Refrigerate dough about 1 hour.

 Mix remaining ingredients in saucepan.  Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until thickened, 2 to 3 minutes; cool.

 Roll dough between two pieces of waxed paper into rectangle, 10x8 inches (moisten surface to keep waxed paper from slipping).

 Spread date mixture evenly over dough.  Roll up tightly, beginning at wide side.

 Wrap in waxed paper; refrigerate until firm enough to slice, about 2 hours.

 Heat oven to 350 degrees.

 Cut into slices about 1/4" thick. (If dough crumbles, let stand at room temperature until softened, about 15 minutes).

 Place on ungreased cookie sheet.   Bake until light brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Makes about 2 1/2 dozen cookies.
