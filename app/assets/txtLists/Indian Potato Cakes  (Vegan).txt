       2         large  potatoes -- (2 to 3)
       1         large  onion -- chopped
       2        cloves  garlic -- chopped (2 to 3)
       2        slices  bread, crusts removed
                        crumbled
       1           tsp  mild curry powder -- (1 to 2)
       1                salt
       1                non-stick spray

Peel potatoes, cut into cubes and boil in water until tender. Mash (may want to add a little water to make mashing them easier).

 Water/broth saute onions and garlic.  Add to mashed potatoes. Add bread crumbs, curry powder and salt.  Cool enough to handle.

 Form 10 to 12 four inch diameter patties and brown them in a non-stick pan sprayed with non-stick spray.

 You can also add cooked carrots, peas, and any other soft cooked vegetables to the potato mixture before browning them. Serve as is or with some Indian condiments like mango chutney or coriander chutney. These patties are pretty easy to make and really good.
