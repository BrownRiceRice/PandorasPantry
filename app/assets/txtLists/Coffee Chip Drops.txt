   1 3/4          cups  all-purpose flour
       1    tablespoon  french roast coffee beans
                        --finely ground
                        --or espresso coffee beans
       1      teaspoon  salt
     3/4      teaspoon  baking soda
   1 1/2          cups  semisweet chocolate chips
     1/2           cup  milk chocolate chips
     1/2           cup  walnuts -- coarsely chopped
      36                chocolate kisses -- unwrapped

Preheat oven to 375 degrees; place sheets of foil on countertop for cooling cookies.  Place the brown sugar, shortening, coffee and vanilla extract in a large bowl. Beat on medium speed of an electric mixer until blended. Add the egg; beat well.  Combine the flour, ground coffee, salt and baking soda.  Add to the shortening mixture; beat on low speed just until blended.  Stir in the chocolate chips and walnuts.  Drop the dough by rounded measuring tablespoonfuls 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets. Bake one baking sheet at a time for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the cookies are lightly browned and just set.  Do no overbake.  Place 1 candy in the center of each cookie.  Cool for 2 minutes on the baking sheet.  Remove the cookies to the foil to cool completely.  Penny Halsey (ATBN65B).
