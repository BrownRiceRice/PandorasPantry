--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Sesame Butter
                        Or  Almond Butter
                        Extra Virgin Olive Oil
                        Water
                        Bragg's Liquid Aminos
                        Cayenne Pepper
       1         Clove  Garlic -- crushed

Take equal parts of raw sesame or almond butter, extra virgin olive oil, and water, dribbles to taste of Bragg's Apple Cider Vinegar and Amino Acids (I know, controversial), cayenne pepper, and a clove of crushed garlic. 

Blend it in a food processor, or if blender, crush the clove. YUM! Great with all and any veggies. Amounts are approximate...experimentation is good.
