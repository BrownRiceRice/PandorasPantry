--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1           cup  Whole wheat flour
                        -- (or 1/3 white + 2/3
                        whole wheat)
     1/2           cup  Water

Put flour in a large bowl with half the water. 
Blend the two together until it holds. 
Beat and knead well until it forms a compact ball. 
Knead dough until it is smooth and elastic. 
Set aside for 30 minutes. 
Knead and divide dough into 4 to 6 parts. 
Roll each ball into a tortilla like flat, about 1/8 inch thick. 
Heat an ungreased skillet. 
Put phulka on it, and let it cook for about 1 minute (The top should just
start to look dry and small bubbles should just start to form). 
Turn and cook the second side for 2/3 minutes until small bubbles form. 
Turn again and cook the first side pressed lightly with a towel. It should
puff. Serve warm (may be slightly buttered).
