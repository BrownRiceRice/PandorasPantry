--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   3 1/2          cups  enriched flour -- unsifted, up to 4
       2      packages  dry yeast
       2   tablespoons  ground cinnamon
       1           Cup  milk
     1/4           cup  water
     1/2           cup  seedless raisins
       2   tablespoons  sugar
       2   tablespoons  oil
       1      teaspoon  salt
                        Corn meal
                        Butter

 Stir together 1 1/2 cups flour, yeast and cinnamon.

 Heat milk, water, raisins, sugar, oil and salt over low heat until very warm (120 to 130 degrees).

 Add warmed ingredients to flour-yeast mixture and beat until smooth, about 1 minute by hand.

 Stir in more flour to make a soft dough.

 Turn out onto lightly floured board and knead until manageable, about 3 minutes.

 Cover dough with bowl or pan and let rest 30 minutes.

 Sprinkle corn meal on flat surface.  Place dough on corn meat and roll out to 1/2" thick.

 Cut into circles with 3 or 4 inch cutter.  Sprinkle corn meat on top of muffins.

 Let rest about 30 minutes or until lightly raised.

 Bake on a preheated electric griddle at 350 degrees; or on a preheated medium-hot Teflon coated griddle; or on a preheated medium-hot skillet that has been sprinkled with corn meal, 15 to 18 minutes on each side.  Watch carefully - see that they do not burn.

 When cool, split, toast and butter.
