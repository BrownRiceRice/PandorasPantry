                        DOUGH
       2         large  eggs
     1/2           cup  milk
     1/4           cup  butter or margarine (1/2 stick) -- cut up
     1/4           cup  water (70: to 80:F)
       1      teaspoon  salt
   3 1/4          cups  bread flour
     1/2           cup  sugar
       1    tablespoon  freshly grated lemon peel
       2     teaspoons  Fleischmann's. Bread Machine Yeast
                        TOPPING
     1/2           cup  almond paste (3 1/2 ounces)
     1/4           cup  bread flour
       1         large  egg -- divided use
     1/4           cup  slivered almonds
       1         whole  clove

To make dough: Measure 2 eggs, milk, butter, water, salt, 3 1/4 cups flour, sugar, lemon peel and yeast into bread machine pan in the order suggested by manufacturer. Process on dough/manual cycle.

To make topping: Combine almond paste, 1/4 cup flour and 1 egg yolk (reserve egg white); knead 5 to 6 times or until smooth. Form into 1/2-inch balls; set aside.

To shape: When cycle is complete, remove dough to floured surface. If necessary, knead in additional flour to make dough easy to handle. Divide dough in half. For wings, roll one half of dough to 10 W 5-inch oval. Arrange in center of greased large baking sheet, curving ends downward. For body, roll remaining half of dough to a triangle, 15 inches high and 6 inches wide (at base); place on center of oval. Fold over top third of triangle from left to right; shape to form dove head. Fold over bottom third of triangle from right to left to form tail. With sharp knife, slash wings and tail at 1-inch intervals to form feathers. 

Lightly beat reserved egg white; brush on dough. Arrange almond paste balls, 1/2 inch apart, on body, tail and wings. Press one slivered almond into each ball. Press clove into head for eye. Cover; let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 45 to 60 minutes.

Bake at 325:F for 35 to 40 minutes or until done. Remove from pan; cool on wire rack.
