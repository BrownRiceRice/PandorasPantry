Put the finely chopped onions into a saucepan with half the vinegar and simmer until nearly soft.  Add the chopped peaches, dried fruit, spice (tied securely in a muslin bag), salt, ground ginger, and just a little more vinegar (enough to stop mixture from burning).



Cook gently until the fruit is soft, stirring from time to time.  Add the remainder of vinegar and thoroughly stir in the sugar.



boil steadily until chutney is thick.  Remove spices and pour into hot jars and seal.  Seal with hot wax or the special bottling jars may be used.
