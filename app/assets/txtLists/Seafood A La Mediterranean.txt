May serve over rice pilaf. 1. To prepare shellfish, de-vein shrimp, leaving shell intact. Scrub mussels and clams well, discarding opened ones. Cut tailfins from lobster tails and leave meat in shell. Cut into 1-inch pieces. 2. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet. Add chopped onion and cook over low heat for 2 minutes. Add garlic and continue to cook for another minute. Do not brown. 3. Add lobster tails and shrimp. Cook for 2 minutes. Add the wine, tomatoes, bay leaves, oregano, Italian parsley, salt and pepper. Increase heat and cook briskly for 6 more minutes. Add the clams and mussels, cover, and continue to cook briskly for 12-15 minutes, or until the clams and mussels are open. Discard any unopened clams or mussels. 4. Remove bay leaves. Transfer stew to a heated serving dish. Sprinkle with chopped curly parsley and serve with crusty bread and a crisp salad.
