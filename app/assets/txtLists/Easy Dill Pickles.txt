--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       4         dozen  Pickling Cucumbers
       1         Bunch  Dill
       1         quart  Cider Vinegar
       8          cups  Water
       1           cup  Pickling Salt
       1        Cloves  Garlic -- peeled

Wash the cucumbers and remove any stems. Cover with cold water and refrigerate overnight or for several hours.
Pack the cucumbers into pint jars as tightly as possible. Poke in 2 springs of dill. Bring the cider vinegar, water, salt and garlic cloves (12 to 16 cloves depending on your taste) to a boil. Boil for 2 minutes. Fish out the garlic cloves with a slotted spoon and put one in each jar (or to taste) while the brine cools slightly. Pour the hot brine into the jars and seal.

Makes 12 Pints
