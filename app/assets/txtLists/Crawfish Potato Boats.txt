Bake potatoes in 425~ for 45 minutes. (Or in the micro). When cool to the touch, cut potatoes lengthwise to remove just the top third. Scoop out pulp, leaving a firm shell about 1/4" thick. Combine potato pulp, butter, milk, onion, cheese and salt. Whip until smooth. Stir in crawfish. Stuff shells with crawfish mixture and sprinkle with paprika. Bake at 425~ for 10 minutes. Garnish with parsley. These freeze well.
