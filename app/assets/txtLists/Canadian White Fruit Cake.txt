     1/2         pound  coconut

     1/2         pound  candied pineapple (red and green) -- cut in thin strips
       4          cups  sifted all-purpose flour
       6                eggs -- separated
   1 1/2          cups  butter
       2          cups  sugar
     3/4           cup  milk
     3/4           cup  pineapple juice
       1      teaspoon  almond extract
       1      teaspoon  cream of tartar

Line 10" tube pan with well-greased brown paper.

Mix pecans, pineapple strips and cherries in large bowl with raisins.

Sift and measure flour. Mix about half a cup with fruit and nuts and coconut.

Cream butter with hand until soft. Work in sugar gradually until mixture is light and fluffy.

Beat egg yolks with fork. Add them gradually to butter mixture, mixing well after each addition.

Combine milk, pineapple juice and almond extract. Add to butter mixture alternately with flour.

Now set oven at 275 degrees.

Beat egg whites until foamy, then add cream of tartar. Continue beating until whites are stiff enough to hold shape but not stiff enough to cling to bowl when tipped.

Pour butter mixture over fruit and nuts and mix well with both hands.

Mix or fold in beaten egg whites.

Pour into pan and bake 3 hours.

Place pan of water in oven with baking cake to keep it moist.

Every few days it may be moistened with pineapple juice.
