--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1         pound  fresh rhubarb -- chopped
     1/2           cup  light brown sugar
       2   tablespoons  fresh ginger -- peeled & diced
     1/4           cup  plain yogurt
     1/4           cup  creme fraiche or sour cream

1.  Heat oven to 350 degrees.  Combine rhubarb and brown sugar in a baking pan or souffle dish. Cover with foil and bake for 25 minutes, or until rhubarb is soft. 

2.  Remove pan from oven.  Stir in ginger, re-cover the pan and leave until at room temperature. 

3.  When ready to serve, portion into bowls.  Mix yogurt and creme fraiche, adding a little brown sugar if you wish. Spoon over compote or pass at the table. 

Note: This compote also makes an excellent base for ice cream. Chicago Tribune, 8/15/93.
