No salad is more characteristic of Mexico than Cactus Salad.  Nopal, or
prickly pear cactus paddles, are fleshy little wedges that are delicious
tossed with a vinaigrette.  The dressing above features aromatic cilantro.


Place cactus, tomatoes, onion and cilantro in glass or plastic bowl.
Shake remaining ingredients in tightly covered jar.  Pour over vegetables;
toss.  Cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours.  Serve on lettuce leaves if
desired.
