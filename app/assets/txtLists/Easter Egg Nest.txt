  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   3 1/2          cups  all-purpose flour (3 1/2 to 4 cups)
     1/3           cup  sugar
       2      packages  Fleischmann's. Rapid Rise Yeast
       2     teaspoons  grated orange peel
       1      teaspoon  salt
     3/4           cup  water
     1/3           cup  milk
     1/4           cup  butter or margarine
       9                eggs
     1/2           cup  chopped almonds -- toasted
                        Food coloring
                        ORANGE ICING
       1           cup  powdered sugar
       2   tablespoons  orange juice

In large bowl, combine 1 1/2 cups flour, sugar, undissolved yeast, orange peel and salt. Heat water, milk and butter until very warm (120: to 130:F); stir into dry ingredients. Stir in 1 egg, almonds and enough remaining flour to make soft dough. Knead on lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 6 to 8 minutes. Cover; let rest on floured surface 10 minutes.

Divide dough in half; roll each to 30-inch rope. Loosely twist ropes together. Place twisted rope on large greased baking sheet; shape into circle and pinch ends together to seal. Place 7 clean eggs, evenly spaced, on dough, pressing between ropes in twist. Cover; let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 20 to 40 minutes.

Beat remaining egg with 1 tablespoon water; brush on dough (not on eggs). Bake at 350:F for 30 to 35 minutes or until done. Remove from sheet; cool on wire rack. 

Brush eggs with food coloring. Drizzle bread with Orange Icing. Serve promptly. Refrigerate any leftover eggs to preserve freshness.
