       2        medium  avocado
       1         large  tomato -- diced
       4                scallion -- with top, sliced
       1                chile serrano -- minced
       2   tablespoons  cilantro -- chopped
       2                lime -- Mexican

Make the chicken soup from a well-grown hen with pieces of meat, skinned  and boned, left in.  The pieces should be fairly large; this is a main dish soup.  *The rice should be cooked in the soup.   Peel and slice the avocados, and cut into 1" pieces.  

The chiles are best chopped fine in a blender.  Halve the limes.  Pour soup into hot earthenware cazuelas, or onion-soup pots, and spoon on the uncooked topping.  Serve with hot tortillas.
