     2/3           cup  water
       5   tablespoons  butter
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     2/3           cup  all-purpose flour
       3                eggs
     3/4           cup  shredded swiss cheese
   1 1/2          cups  small spinach leaves
       8                cherry tomatoes
                        egg-vegetable salad-----
     1/2           cup  mayonnaise
       1      teaspoon  dijon mustard
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cumin
       1           cup  raw cauliflower -- sliced
     1/4         pound  raw mushrooms -- thinly sliced
       1           cup  frozen peas (thawed)
       1           cup  celery -- thinly sliced
       2                green onions & tops -- sliced
       6                hard-cooked eggs

In a 2-quart pan, bring water, butter, and salt to a boil.  When butter melts, remove pan from heat and add flour all at once.  Beat until well blended. Return pan to medium heat and stir rapidly for 1 minute or until a ball forms in middle of pan and a film forms on bottom of pan.  Remove pan from heat and beat in eggs, one at a time, until mixture is smooth and glossy. Add cheese and beat until well mixed.  Spoon into a greased 9-inch round pan with removable bottom or spring-release sides.  Spread evenly over bottom and up sides of pan. Bake crust in a 400 degree oven for 40 minutes or until puffed and brown; turn off oven.  With a wooden pick, prick crust in 10 to 12 places; leave in closed oven for about 10 minutes to dry.  Remove pan from oven and cool completely.  Remove crust from pan. Prepare egg-vegetable salad.  In a bowl, stir all ingredients except eggs together as listed.  Coarsely chop the 6 hard-cooked eggs; gently fold into vegetable mixture. Line bottom and sides of boat with spinach leaves.  Cut each tomato in half.  Pile egg salad over spinach and garnish with cherry tomatoes. Cut boat in thick wedges.
