     1/2           cup  butter or margarine -- softened
     1/3           cup  packed brown sugar
       1                Egg yolk
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
       1           cup  flour
       2     teaspoons  ground ginger
     1/2           cup  natural raisins
     1/3           cup  chopped candied ginger

 Cream butter and sugar.  Beat in yolk and salt.

 Mix flour and ground ginger, mix into yolk mixture just to blend thoroughly.  Mix in raisins and candied ginger to distribute evenly.

 On lightly floured surface, roll into a 12" long.  Wrap securely and refrigerate at least 1 hour and up to 1 week.

 With sharp knife, cut 1/3" thick slices, and place 1" apart on baking sheets.

 Bake in preheated 350 degree oven 15 to 20 minutes until cookies are set and bottoms are lightly browned.

 Remove to racks to cool completely.

 Decorate as desired with melted semi-sweet or white chocolate, and top with colored sprinkles, raisins, nuts, or candied fruit pieces.

 Allow to set before storing in layers between sheets of waxed paper in airtight container.
