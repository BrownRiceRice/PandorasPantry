                        (approx. 32 oz ea)
     1/2           cup  ketchup
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  pepper
       1           cup  oil
       1            md  eggplants
     1/2           cup  grated parmesan cheese
       1    tablespoon  chopped parsley

     1/2         pound  mozzarella cheese
                        thinly sliced

Add 1 or 2 creole tomatoes, if they are in season (These are tomatoes local to New Orleans.  They are delicious!!)  Simmer onion, garlic, tomatoes, ketchup, salt and pepper for 30 minutes. Add 1/2 c oil to frying pan while other mixture is simmering. Slice eggplant into 1/2 inch slices (slice only enough to fit into fry pan) Do NOT slice ahead of time.)  Add eggplant to HOT oil. Fry until slightly browned.  Press each slice against side of pan to drain oil before removing.  Add more oil as needed.

 Mix Parmesan cheese, parsley, bread crumbs, and oregano in a bowl.

 Place one layer of eggplant in a flat casserole dish. Sprinkle with bread crumb mixture and cover with tomato mixture.  Alternate layers and top with mozzarella cheese.

Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.
