                        -----crust-----
       2           cup  unbleached flour -- sifted
       4    tablespoon  butter -- no margarine
     1/2           cup  sugar -- granulated
       1                egg -- large
       1      teaspoon  baking powder
                        -----cheesecake-----
       3           cup  cottage cheese -- 1 1/2 lbs
     1/2           cup  cornstarch
       1      teaspoon  baking soda
       1           cup  sugar -- granulated
       4                eggs -- large
     1/2      teaspoon  lemon rind -- grated
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract -- real only
       1           cup  sour cream
       1           cup  raisins

CRUST: In a large mixing bowl, blend all the ingredients, cutting in the butter and working the mixture with your hands until it is well mixed and workable. Divide the dough into 2 equal portions.  Use one half to line the bottom of a greased 9-inch springform pan, the other half to line the sides of the pan.  Either roll out the dough or press it in with your fingers. Chill before filling. CHEESECAKE: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Press the cottage cheese through a sieve. Combine the cornstarch and the baking powder and set aside.  In a large mixing bowl, combine the cottage cheese with the sugar, eggs, lemon rind and vanilla. Beat until very smooth. Add the dry mixture to the cheese and blend well.  Stir in the sour cream and raisins.  Pour the cheese mixture into the prepared crust and bake for one hour, or until done. The center will remain soft. Turn off the oven and prop the door open.  Allow the cake to cool to room temperature. Serve at room temperature as well.
