       1           cup  butter or margarine
       2                eggs
     1/2           cup  powdered sugar
       8        ounces  semi sweet chocolate squares
       2   tablespoons  milk
       2     teaspoons  instant coffee powder
      25                graham crackers

Cream butter with eggs and powdered sugar, whipping until light and fluffy. In top of double boiler, melt chocolate over hot water. Blend in the milk and coffee powder, stirring well until blended. Fold into egg mix. If mix is to thin to spread easily, chill for a few minutes, stirring to check once in a while, as it will get firm when cold. Line a 9x5" loaf pan with plastic wrap. Spread 1/4" layer of chocolate mix on the bottom of pan. Top with a layer of graham crackers. Spread 1/4" of chocolate mix. Repeat this process 5 times. Spread remaining chocolate mix over top and sides. Wrap and chill for 2 hours or more until firm. To serve; remove torte from pan. Peel off plastic wrap. Smooth surface with knife dipped in hot water. Place on serving plate. Slices best after it has been at room temperature for 30 minutes.
