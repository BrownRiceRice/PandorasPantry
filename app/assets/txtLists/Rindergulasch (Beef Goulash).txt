       1         pound  round steak -- cubed
       3                onions; medium -- chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  garlic salt
       1      teaspoon  paprika

Heat vegetable oil in a large fry pan or Dutch oven.  Add meat cubes and brown well, approximately 10 minutes.  Stir in onions; cook until soft. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, garlic salt, paprika, and sugar.  Blend thoroughly.  Pour in hot water; cover and simmer gently about 1 1/2 hours. In a small jar or container, shake or blend flour with cold water.  Be sure to break up all lumps.  Add to meat about 7 minutes before the end of the cooking time.  Stir constantly until sauce is thickened and bubbling. Remove from heat; stir in cream.  Serve with noodles, accompanied by a tomato salad if desired.
