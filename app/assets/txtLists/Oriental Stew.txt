       5          cups  vegetable stock
       1            sm  onion, thinly sliced
       1        cloves  garlic, minced
       1    tablespoon  minced gingeroot
   1 1/2   tablespoons  soy sauce
       1         stalk  bok choy
                        sweet red pepper, julienned
       1           cup  broccoli florets
                        carrot, shredded
       1           cup  sliced mushrooms (3 oz)
     1/2           cup  peas
       2        ounces  buckwheat noodles (1/2 cup)
     1/2         pound  firm tofu, cut in 1/2" cubes
     1/4           cup  watercress leaves

GARNISH: blanched peapods, thin scallion slices, celery leaves, toasted sesame seeds, finely shredded lettuce or watercress leaves, Optional.  Place 1/2 cup of the vegetable stock in a Dutch oven or 3 1/2 - 5 qt saucepan and bring to a boil. Add onion, garlic, and ginger; simmer for 3 minutes. Stir in remaining stock and soy sauce. Cover pot and bring to a gentle boil. Add remaining ingredients.  Test for doneness: noodles should be softened; vegetables should remain crisp/tender. Timing - about 8 minutes. Top each serving with one of the garnishes. VARIATIONS: - substitute 1 C cooked brown rice for the buckwheat noodles peppers, chopped water chestnut, chopped jicama root, shredded spinach, chopped celery, or bamboo shoots. EGG THREADS: In a small skillet, heat a little margarine. When it begins to bubble, add 1 egg beaten with a little cold water. Tilt the pan so the yolk mixture coats it in a thin layer, the thinner the better. When the egg is lightly cooked, turn it out onto a cutting board. Slice it into very thin strips with a sharp knife. (makes about 1/3 cup)
