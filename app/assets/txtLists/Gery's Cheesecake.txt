                        -----filling-----
       1         pound  cream cheese
       1           cup  sugar
       5                eggs
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
   1 1/2      teaspoon  vanilla
                        -----topping-----
       1          pint  sour cream
     1/2           cup  sugar
       1      teaspoon  vanilla
                        sweetened berries optional
                        -----crust-----
       1                graham cracker-deep-dish

Filling:  Combine cheese and sugar and mix thoroughly. Add eggs one at a time, beating after each addition. Beat in salt and vanilla. Turn into prepared graham cracker crust. Bake 1 hour in preheated 325 oven. Topping: Combine sour cream, sugar and vanilla. Spread over top of cream cheese mixture.  Return to oven for 5 minutes. Remove and place to chill. Serve plain or with berries.  Makes one deep-dish pie. I have doubled this and placed in a 11 x 8. Works beautifully. (Prepare crust by using boxed crushed graham cracker crumbs mixed with butter and press into dish) FROM: GERY DORONY, cousin to Lisa Crawley TSPN00B. NOTE: YIELD=1 deep dish plus a couple individual custard cups or it WILL overflow, ASK ROBBIE! <G>
