Boil potatoes in their jackets. Let cool, then peel and chop into large chunks. Mix mayonnaise, yellow mustard, Louisiana hot sauce, and salt together. Add potatoes, along with the rest of the ingredients, and mix well. You can make this the day before and refrigerate it overnight. You may need to put a little more dressing on it if it is a little dry.
