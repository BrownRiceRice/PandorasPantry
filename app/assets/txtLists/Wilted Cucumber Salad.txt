--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       4         large  cukes peeled and very thin sliced
       1    tablespoon  fresh dill or 1 tsp. dried dill weed
       6   tablespoons  canola oil
       2     teaspoons  dijon mustard
       2   tablespoons  white wine vinegar
       1    tablespoon  salt for the wilting process (to be rinsed
                        off)
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar substitute or the real thing
                        salt and freshly ground black pepper

Put cuke slices in a colander with the tablespoon of salt and let them wilt for bout an hour.  Rinse salt off and press out the excess water. Combine cukes with all else and chill. Toss again before serving. This is a very light and refreshing salad which makes a nice accompaniment- to any entree at any season of the year. I like to keep it around for munchies and side dishes for dinner or lunch. Makes 4-6 Servings.
