       8          cups  homemade chicken broth
       2         large  carrots -- chopped
       1         stalk  celery -- chopped
       2        cloves  garlic -- peeled and crushed
       1      teaspoon  salt
   1 1/2          cups  fresh breadcrumbs
     2/3           cup  grated Parmesan cheese -- plus extra for garni
       1      teaspoon  nutmeg -- freshly grated
       2         large  eggs
       1           cup  fresh parsley -- chopped

Pour chicken broth into a large pot and bring to a boil.  Add carrots, celery, garlic and salt.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 30 minutes.  Meanwhile, in a mixing bowl, combine breadcrumbs, cheese and nutmeg.  Make a well in the center and add eggs; mix until thoroughly combined.  

The dough should be damp but firm.  If necessary, incorporate additional breadcrumbs or a few drops of water; if the dough is too wet or too dry it will crumble.  To form the passatelli, pinch off a piece of dough and roll it about 1/4 inch thick, then break it into 1/2 inch lengths. 

sContinue forming the rest of the dough in the same manner.  Bring the broth back to a boil, add the passatelli and parsley and cook for 5 minutes. Ladle the soup into bowls, sprinkle with a little Parmesan and serve.
