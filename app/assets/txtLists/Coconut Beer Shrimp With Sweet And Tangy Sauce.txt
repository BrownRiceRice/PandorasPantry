--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1    tablespoon  cayenne pepper
   2 1/4     teaspoons  paprika -- sweet
   1 1/2     teaspoons  pepper -- black
   1 1/4     teaspoons  garlic powder
     3/4      teaspoon  onion powder
     3/4      teaspoon  thyme -- dried
     3/4      teaspoon  oregano -- dried
                        -----shrimp coating-----
       2                eggs
   1 3/4          cups  flour; all purpose -- in all
     3/4           cup  beer -- fresh
       1    tablespoon  baking powder
      48                shrimp; medium -- peeled (but
                        tails on)& deveined
       3          cups  coconut; grated -- about 6 oz.
                        -----sweet & tangy dipping sauce-----
   1 2/3          cups  orange marmalade -- an 18 oz.
       5   tablespoons  mustard -- creole or brown
       5   tablespoons  horseradish -- finally grated

Combine all ingredients of the Sweet and Tangy Dipping Sauce and refrigerate. Thoroughly combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl. In a separate bowl combine 2 ts of the mix with the eggs, 1 1/4 c of the flour, the beer and baking powder; mix well, breaking up any lumps. In a separate small bowl combine the remaining 1/2 c flour with 1 1/2 ts of the seasoning mix; set aside. Place the coconut in a separate bowl. Sprinkle both sides of the shrimp with the remaining seasoning mix. Then, holding the shrimp by the tail, dredge each in the flour mixture, shaking off excess, then dip in batter (except tail), allowing excess to drip off, and then coat generously with grated coconut and place on a baking sheet. Heat oil in a deep fryer to 350 degree F. Drop shrimp, one at a time, into the hot oil and fry until golden brown, about 30 seconds to 1 minute per side. Do not crowd. (You may want to cut the first shrimp in half after frying to best estimate frying time; the batter should be cooked through but the shrimp not overcooked.) Drain on paper towels. Serve immediately with Sweet and Tangy Dipping Sauce.
