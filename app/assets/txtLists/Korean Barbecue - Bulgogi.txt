Bulgogi or Bulgalbi, broiled (grilled) beef strips and beef ribs respectively, exemplify an age-old tradition of cooking on a curved iron hotplate - a tradition that is matched in northern China and neighboring Mongolia as introduced by the Manchurians. Today this has been streamlined for table service, with specially built cone-shaped hotplates fitted over tabletop burners, to provide an enjoyable and intimate eating experience. Meats of all kinds, including mutton, pork and poultry, offal and seafood, are cooked in this way, being first marinated in a spicy mixture encompassing the characteristic seasonings: soy sauce, sesame oil, garlic, ginger, pepper or chili, toasted sesame seeds and green onions. The meat is marinated well in advance so that the flavor is intense. Cooking time is minimal - just enough to cook through and seal the surface. Serve Bulgogi with white rice and yangnyum kanjang sauce, together with a selection of accompanimen! ts suc h as kim chee (chili pickled cabbage) and jeot khal (spiced whitefish). Cut the beef across the grain into very thin slices, then cut into narrow strips. In a glass or stainless steel dish mix all remaining ingredients together. Add the beef and stir thoroughly. Cover and let marinate for at least 3 hours.  Preheat a tabletop broiler (Hibachi or Ghengis Kahn Cooker), protecting the tabletop with an asbestos mat or other suitable heat shield.  Each diner, or the host/hostess, places a portion of meat on the broiler (griller) and cooks it quickly on both sides. The meat is dipped into the sauce before eating. Use wooden chopsticks or small forks/fondue forks.
