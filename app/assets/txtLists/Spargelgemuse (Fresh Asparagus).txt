Wash asparagus spears and trim off tough ends.  Place asparagus in boiling salted water and cook until tender, 7 to 10 minutes.  Drain off liquid. In a small saucepan, melt the butter, cook over low heat until lightly browned.  Sprinkle freshly grated cheese over butter and mix.  Spoon over asparagus.  Garnish with sliced hard boiled egg.
