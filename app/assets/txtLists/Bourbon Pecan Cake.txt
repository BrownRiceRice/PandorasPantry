--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       2          cups  whole red candied cherries
       2          cups  white seedless raisins
       2          cups  bourbon
       5          cups  sifted flour
       4          cups  pecan halves
   1 1/2     teaspoons  baking powder
       1      teaspoon  salt
       2     teaspoons  ground nutmeg
       2          cups  butter -- softened
       2          cups  granulated sugar
       2          cups  firmly-packed dark brown sugar
       8                eggs -- separated

Combine cherries, raisins and bourbon in a large bowl; cover tightly. Let fruit marinate in refrigerator overnight.

Preheat oven to 275 degrees.

Grease large tube pan and 1 loaf pan; line bottoms of both pans with waxed paper. Grease and flour waxed paper.

Combine 1/2 cup flour with pecans.

In a large bowl sift remaining flour with baking powder, salt and nutmeg.

Place butter in large mixing bowl; beat with electric mixer at medium speed until light and fluffy.

Add sugars gradually, beating until well blended.

Add egg yolks; scrape sides of bowl occasionally with rubber spatula.

Add 2 cups sifted dry ingredients to creamed mixture; mix thoroughly.

Drain bourbon from fruit; add bourbon alternately with remaining sifted dry ingredients to creamed mixture, ending with dry ingredients, beating well after each addition and scraping sides of bowl often.

Beat egg whites stiff but not dry; fold gently into cake batter, blending thoroughly.

Pour into prepared pans.

Large tube requires nearly 2 hours in preheated 275 degree oven; the smaller pan needs less time.

Cool cakes in pans on wire rack 10 minutes.

Remove from pans and peel off waxed paper; cool completely on rack.

Wrap cakes in cheesecloth saturated with bourbon; then wrap in plastic wrap.

Store in tight containers up to several weeks.

NOTE: Some people do not like the cheesecloth completely saturated with the bourbon, it does come out a little strong tasting.
