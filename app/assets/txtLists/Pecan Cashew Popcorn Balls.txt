--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1           cup  sugar
       1           cup  brown sugar -- firm pack
       1           cup  light corn syrup
     2/3           cup  water
       1         pound  butter
       2          cups  pecan halves -- toasted
       2          cups  cashews -- lightly toasted
       8          cups  popped popcorn

Combine the granulated sugar, brown sugar, corn syrup and water in a heavy pan fitted with a candy thermometer and place over high heat. Bring mixture to a boil and add the butter, stirring until it has melted. Continue cooking until the mixture reached 350:, 20-30 minutes. In a LARGE, lightly oiled bowl, toss the nuts and popcorn together. Carefully pour the  hot syrup over the popcorn- nut mixture. Carefully, but quickly, toss the mixture with a long-handled wooden spoon to coat the popcorn and nuts completely with syrup. As soon as the mixture is cool enough to handle, quickly shape into 3" balls and place the balls onto a nonstick or lightly oiled baking sheet to cool. Store, tightly wrapped, in a cool place. Wrap popcorn balls individually in squares of amber cellophane, tied up with gold or orange and black ribbon (these are meant for Halloween). Or pile the balls together into a basket with red apples and wrap the basket up in cellophane with orange and black ribbon. Or place the balls in a brown paper bag and tie with a ribbon.
