       5                (5 to 6) duck webs
     1/2         pound  Broccoli
       2                (2 to 3) Chinese dried mushrooms -- soaked
       2        slices  Ginger root -- peeled
       2                Scallions (spring onions)
       2   tablespoons  Rice wine (or sherry)
       1      teaspoon  Soy sauce
     1/2    tablespoon  Sugar
       1      teaspoon  Salt
       1                Star anise
       2   tablespoons  Oyster sauce
       1      teaspoon  Sesame seed oil
       1    tablespoon  Cornstarch (corn flour)
       4   tablespoons  Oil

Remove the outer skin of the duck webs; wash and clean well. Crush the ginger root and onions. Heat up 2 tablespoons (30 ml) oil; toss in the crushed ginger root and onions followed by the duck webs; stir a few times; add rice wine or sherry and soy sauce. After 5 minutes or so, transfer the entire contents to a sand-pot or casserole.

Add sugar, a little salt, star anise and a little stock or water. Simmer gently for 3 hours. Just before serving, stir-fry the broccoli or greens with the Chinese dried mushrooms, a little salt and sugar. Place them on a serving dish, then arrange the duck webs on top of that.

Meanwhile heat a little oil in a saucepan, add oyster sauce and sesame seed oil. Thicken with cornstarch (corn flour) mixed with a little cold water; when it is smooth, pour it over the duck webs and serve. The oyster sauce enriches the subtle taste of the duck webs.
