Saute the onion until light golden color, add scallion and cut-up meats, turning meats several times.  Add dill, salt and pepper, and enough broth to cover.

 Beat eggs; add lemon juice, beating it in well. Slowly add some of the hot liquid from the pot, stirring constantly. After the egg-lemon mixture is well blended, pour it into the soup; stir. Serve hot.
