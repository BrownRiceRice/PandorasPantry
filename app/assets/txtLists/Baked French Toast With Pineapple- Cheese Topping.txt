                        PINNEAPPLE-CHEESE TOPPING
     1/4           cup  canned, juice-packed pineapple -- crushed,undrained
       4        ounces  light Neufchatel or light cream cheese -- softened and cubed
     1/4      teaspoon  vanilla
                        FRENCH TOAST
       3                extra-large egg whites
                        OR
     1/2           cup  Egg Exchange
   1 1/4           cup  nonfat or lowfat milk
       2   Tablespoons  orange juice
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
       6        slices  French bread -- (1-inch-thick)
                        Sifted confectioner's sugar

In blender container or food processor bowl (or use electric mixer), place the pineapple, cream cheese and vanilla. Cover and process briefly so some chunks of pineapple remain. Cover and refrigerate until needed.
For French toast, in bowl whisk together egg whites, milk, orange juice and cinnamon until well blended. If baking toast immediately, preheat oven to 425'F. Spray 15x l0 x 2-inch jelly-roll pan (or cookie sheet with sides) with aerosol cooking spray. Pour egg mixture into pan. Arrange bread slices in egg mixture, turn to coat well on both sides. (If preparing ahead, cover pans and refrigerate up to 12 hours before baking).
If baking immediately, let bread stand 5 minutes to soak up liquid. Bake 10 to 12 minutes, turning bread slices over halfway through the baking time. To serve, arrange three slices bread on each plate; sprinkle with confectioner's sugar. Top with a dollop of Pineapple-Cheese Topping. Serve with remaining topping.
