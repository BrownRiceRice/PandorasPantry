                        castillo   (hjdd64b)
       1           cup  sourdough starter
       1    tablespoon  sea salt
       2      packages  dry yeast
       5          cups  whole wheat flour -- to 6 c.
     1/2           cup  warm water (110f)
       2                eggs -- beaten
   1 1/4          cups  boiling water
       6   tablespoons  rolled oats
       1           cup  rolled oats
       1                egg white -- beaten
     2/3           cup  light molasses -- (or honey)
       1    tablespoon  water
     1/3           cup  safflower oil

Measure out sourdough starter. Soften yeast in warm water. Combine boiling water, oats, molasses, oil and salt. Cool to lukewarm. Stir in 2 c. flour. Beat well. Add to sourdough starter along with softened yeast and eggs. Stir in enough of remaining flour to make a soft dough. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead 5 - 8 minutes or until smooth and elastic. Shape dough into a ball and place in lightly greased bowl, turning once. Cover with a cloth and set in a warm place free from drafts and let rise 1 to 2 hours or until doubled in size. Punch down dough and turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide dough in half. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes. Coat 2 well greased loaf pans with about 3 tbsp oats per pan. Shape dough into loaves and place in pans. Cover and let rise in warm place for 1 1/2 hours or until doubled in size. Brush loaves with mixture of egg white and water. Sprinkle tops lightly with rolled oats. Bake at 375F for 40 to 50 minutes or until done(I find mine are always done at  35 minutes so watch carefully). Makes 2 loaves.
