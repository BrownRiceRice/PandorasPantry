   1 1/2          cups  all-purpose flour
     3/4           cup  sugar, granulated
       1    tablespoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
     1/3           cup  firm butter, or margarine
       1           cup  blueberries
       1                egg
     1/2           cup  milk
       1      teaspoon  vanilla
                        powdered sugar
                        walnut streusel*

Prepare Walnut Streusel (Recipe follows).  Pat about half the streusel into a greased, flour-dusted 9-inch tube pan or layer cake pan with a removable bottom; set aside. In a large bowl, stir together flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, salt and nutmeg.  Using a pastry blender or 2 knives, cut in the butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Gently stir in the blueberries. Beat egg lightly with milk and vanilla; stir into berry mixture just until combined.  Spread half the batter in streusel-lined pan; sprinkle with remaining streusel, then spread with remaining batter. Bake in a 350 degrees oven until a pick inserted in center comes out clean (about 45 to 60 minutes).  Let cool in pan for 20 minutes, then remove pan sides.  Dust with powdered sugar.  Serve warm or cool. *Walnut Streusel: Mix 1/2 cup each finely chopped walnuts and firmly packed brown sugar, 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon, and 2 tablespoons melted butter or margarine.
