       2           cup  unbleached flour -- sifted
     1/2           cup  sugar
       3      teaspoon  baking powder
       1      teaspoon  salt
       2      teaspoon  pumpkin pie spice
     1/2           cup  quick-cooking oats
       1           cup  chopped dried apricots
     1/2           cup  chopped walnuts

Sift together flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and pumpkin pie spice into large mixing bowl.  Stir in oats, apricots, and walnuts.

 Combine eggs, milk and oil in small bowl; blend well.  Add all at once to dry ingredients, stirring just enough to moisten.  Spoon batter into greased 3-inch muffin-pan cups, fill 2/3rds full.
