      10        ounces  raspberries -- or any other
                        berry
   1 1/2          cups  vodka -- or 1 cup vodka and
     1/2             c  brandy
     1/4           cup  sugar syrup *

* Sugar syrup.  1 cup sugar boiled with 1/2 cup water till sugar is thoroughly dissolved. Be sure mixture is cooled before using.

 Add juice and berries to alcohol. Stir and steep one week. Strain. Crush berries through strainer and filter. Taste. Add sugar syrup as necessary. Many frozen fruits are already heavily pre-sugared. If using unsugared fruits without syrup, treat them as fresh fruit but reduce the amount of water when making the sugar syrup because of the water content in the frozen fruit.  Yield. About 2 cups.
