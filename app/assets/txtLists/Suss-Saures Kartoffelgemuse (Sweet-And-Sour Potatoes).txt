       1                onion; medium -- diced
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  pepper
     3/4           cup  sugar
       4                bacon; slices -- cut up
     3/4           cup  vinegar

Peel and cube potatoes.  Add diced onion, salt, pepper, and sugar. Reserve in a covered bowl.  In a small frypan, fry the bacon until crisp. Add the vinegar to the hot bacon and bring to a boil.  Pour immediately over potato mixture, mix well.  If too tart, add a little more sugar before serving.  Cut endive or leaf lettuce add to this is very good.
