                        -----for the beef rolls-----
   1 1/2         pound  top round -- very thin sliced
     1/2           cup  fresh basil -- minced
       2                roasted red peppers -- diced
       4    tablespoon  parmesan -- fresh grated
       2    tablespoon  parsley -- minced
                        salt and pepper
       6                sl            proscuitto -- very thin
                        -----for the marinade-----
       2    tablespoon  olive oil
       2    tablespoon  parsley -- minced
     1/4           cup  balsamic vinegar
       2    tablespoon  pepper -- black fresh ground
       2        cloves  garlic -- finely minced
     1/4           cup  olive oil

Place beef slices on counter or flat surface. (Get your butcher to slice them; he can do it so much neater than we can!) Sprinkle with the red peppers and parsley. Cut proscuitto to fit each beef slice and place over peppers.  Sprinkle with basil leaves, Parmesan and pepper. Roll tightly and tie in two places with kitchen twine to secure, or use toothpicks. Combine all marinade ingredients and pour over beef rolls in non-reactive pan. Let set at room temp for an hour, or refrigerate for several hours. Remove from marinade, reserving marinade.  Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in large heavy skillet.  Brown beef rolls on all sides. Add marinade and simmer for 20 minutes.  Or you can put into tightly covered baking dish and bake at 350 for 15-20 minutes.  Adapted from a recipe by Della Masia ().
