                        spalding
       5        pounds  fresh peas
       4                scallions
   1 1/4          cups  oil or
       1           cup  butter
   1 1/2        pounds  tomatoes, peeled -- strained or
       1    tablespoon  tomato paste diluted with:
       2          cups  water
       3   tablespoons  dill -- chopped
                        salt & pepper to taste
                        water as needed

Shell, wash and drain peas.  Chop white part of the scallions into small pieces., and the green part into lge. pcs. Heat oil in large pot. Add the scallions and cook until soft but not browned. Add the peas and brown very lightly.  Add the tomatoes (or the diluted paste), dill, salt, and pepper. Add enough water to half cover the peas. Cover the pot. Cook over medium heat until only the oil remains and the liquid has been absorbed (abt. 45 min.).

 NOTE:   You can make this without the tomatoes, if you wish. In that case, add just enough water to cover the peas.
