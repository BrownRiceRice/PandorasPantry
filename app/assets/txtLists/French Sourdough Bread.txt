--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1       package  yeast -- (or 1 1/2 tsp)
       3          cups  bread flour
       1      teaspoon  salt
       1      teaspoon  sugar
       1    tablespoon  cornmeal
       1    tablespoon  gluten
     1/4      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2           cup  sourdough starter
       2     teaspoons  olive oil or butter
       1           cup  warm water

Put all ingreds. in order listed into pan, select "French" bread and push Start.  Tip: If you can, open lid and check while kneading to feel whether the dough is too wet or dry. Correct it with a Tbsp. or so of water or flour. Since you have made so much bread, you know how the dough should feel. FROM:    JUDY GARNETT (PJXG05A)
