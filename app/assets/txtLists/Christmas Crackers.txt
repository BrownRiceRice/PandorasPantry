--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  butter or margarine -- melted
     1/2           cup  honey
     1/3           cup  light brown sugar -- packed
       2         large  eggs
   2 1/2          cups  whole-wheat flour
   1 1/2          cups  all-purpose flour
   1 1/2     teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
       3   tablespoons  sugar

In large bowl, with wire whisk or fork, beat margarine or butter, honey, brown sugar, and eggs just until blended. With spoon, stir in whole-wheat flour and remaining ingredients except sugar. Divide dough into 3 balls. Wrap 2 balls in plastic wrap; refrigerate until ready to use. Preheat oven to 350`F. On floured large cookie sheet, with floured rolling pin, roll remaining ball of dough into a rectangle slightly larger than 15x13-inch. Trim side to make 15x12 inch rectangle. Using dull edge of knife, score rectangle lengthwise into 3 strips; score each strips crosswise into 5 rectangles. Decorate center of each rectangle by pressing favorite holiday cookie cutter into dough by making sure not to cut all the way through. (Use the same cookie cutter for all rectangles or choose as many different ones to decorate rectangles as you like.) Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon sugar. Bake 8 to 10 minutes until edges begin to brown.  Cook on cookie sheet on wire rack 2 minutes;  slice onto rack to cook completely. Repeat with remaining dough and sugar. When cool, break each large rectangle into 15 smaller rectangle along scored line. Makes 45 crackers.
