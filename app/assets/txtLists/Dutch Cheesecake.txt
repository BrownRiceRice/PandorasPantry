NOTE: Use an 8-inch tart pan in this recipe. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.  In a large mixing bowl, beat together the egg yolks and 1/4 cup of the confectioners' sugar until well blended ~- about 5 minutes. Beat in the cheese, cream, flour, lemon juice, lemon rind and raisins. Beat the egg whites until frothy, then gradually add the remaining confectioners' sugar and continue to beat until the whites form stiff peaks. Fold the egg whites into the cheese mixture. Pour the cheese mixture into the prepared crust and bake for 45 minutes.  Cool to room temperature, then chill before serving.
