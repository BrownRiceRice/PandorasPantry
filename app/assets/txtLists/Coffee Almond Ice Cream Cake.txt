--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1 1/2          cups  chocolate wafer crumbs (about 30 cookies)
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter -- melted
   1 1/2         pints  coffee ice cream -- slightly
                        softened
   1 1/2          cups  heavy cream -- well chilled
       1      teaspoon  vanilla
   1 1/2          cups  amaretti -- crushed
     1/2           cup  almonds; sliced -- toasted
                        dark chocolate sauce

In a bowl with a fork, stir together the crumbs and butter until the mixture is well combined. Pat the mixture onto the bottom and 1" up the sides of a lightly oiled 8", 2-1/2" deep springform pan. Freeze crust for 30 minutes or until firm.  Spread ice cream evenly on the crust and return to freezer for 30 minutes or until ice cream is firm. In a bowl with an electric mixer, beat cream with vanilla until it holds stiff peaks, fold in amaretti thoroughly and spread over ice cream. Smooth top of cake, sprinkle with almonds, and freeze cake for 30-45 minutes, or until top is firm. Freeze cake, covered with plastic wrap and foil, overnight. Just before serving, wrap a warm damp towel around the side of the pan, remove side of pan, and transfer cake to a serving plate. Cut into wedges with a knife dipped in hot water and serve it with the Dark Chocolate Sauce.
