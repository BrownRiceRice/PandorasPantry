   1 1/2          cups  white flour
     1/2           cup  cooking oil
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  dry skim milk powder

     3/4           cup  sourdough
       1           cup  blueberries

Place first five ingredients in mixing bowl. Dissolve soda and salt in water and add to mixing bowl along with egg and sourdough starter. Mix just until all ingredients are blended...by hand, not with mixer. Add blueberries and mix in carefully so as not to break the skin on the berries.  Spoon into greased muffin tin..filling cups half full.
