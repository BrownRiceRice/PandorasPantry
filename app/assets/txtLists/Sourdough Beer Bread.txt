     1/2           cup  flat beer

       3           cup  bread flour

       1    tablespoon  sugar
   1 1/2      teaspoon  yeast

Place all the ingredients in the machine and program for basic white bread. Set the temperature control to Dark and press Start. Suggest is to flatten beer, pour it into a small saucepan and heat it to a simmer. By the time the beer cools down, it will be flat.
