 Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

 In heavy saucepan melt butter over low heat; add chocolate and heat just until melted and smooth, stirring occasionally.  Remove from heat.

 Meanwhile, beat egg yolks, sugar and vanilla in small bowl until thoroughly blended.

 In another bowl beat egg whites to form soft peaks.

 Beat yolk mixture and flour into chocolate mixture; mix in about 1/4 of the egg whites.

 With rubber spatula fold remaining egg whites into chocolate mixture to blend thoroughly.

 Oil an 8" square baking pan and line with a piece of wax paper 8" long, allowing two opposite ends to extend up sides of pan.

 Pour chocolate mixture into pan; cut through several times with spatula to release air bubbles.

 Bake in center of oven 25 to 35 minutes until firm and slightly cracked around edges.

 Cool on rack 10 minutes.

 Loosen edges with knife and lift out of pan with ends of wax paper; cool completely. (Cake will sink in middle.)

 Carefully spread top of cake with icing.

 Cut into 1 1/2" squares, cleaning knife as needed between cuts.

 Before icing sets, decorate tops as desired.

Makes about 4 dozen bars.
