--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  butter -- softened
       1           cup  sugar
       2                eggs
     1/2           cup  buttermilk
       1      teaspoon  vanilla
     1/2           cup  semisweet chocolate chips
                        melted
   2 1/4          cups  flour
       1      teaspoon  baking powder
       1      teaspoon  baking soda
       1         pinch  salt (opt)
       1           cup  pecans -- chopped
     1/2           cup  glaced cherries -- chopped

Beat together first 5 ingredients until blended. Beat in melted chocolate. Combine and add next 4 ingredients and stir until dry ingredients are just moistened. Do not overmix. Stir in pecans and cherries. Divide batter between 3 greased and lightly floured mini-loaf foil pans (6x3x2"), place pans on a cookie sheet, and bake in a 325~ oven for 45-50 minutes, or until a cake tester, inserted in center, comes out clean. Allow to cool for 15 minutes and then remove from pans and continue cooling on a rack. When cool, drizzle tops with Creamy Cherry Glaze. Yields 3 mini-loaves.
