--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1           cup  cornmeal -- white
       2           cup  boiling water
     1/4           cup  butter -- melted
       1      teaspoon  salt
   1 1/2           cup  milk
       3                egg yolks
       4                egg whites -- stiffly beaten

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Stir the cornmeal gradually into the rapidly boiling water.  When the mixture is smooth, add butter, salt and stir in the milk.  Remove from heat and stir in the egg yolks.  Allow the mixture to cool to warm (90-100 degrees).  Meanwhile, beat the egg whites to hold a peak.  Fold into the mixture.  Pour batter into the baking dish (one 1-quart baking dish, greased or buttered).  It should come to no more than 3/4 way up the sides.  Level with rubber spatula.  Bake in the oven until it is puffed and nicely browned.  A knife blade slipped into the bread will come out clean when it is done.

Remove bread from the oven.  Serve immediately, and with a spoon.
