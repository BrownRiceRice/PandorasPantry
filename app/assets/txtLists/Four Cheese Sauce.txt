--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2      teaspoon  flour
       2         ounce  mozzarella
   1 1/8           cup  milk
       2         ounce  gruyere
      12         ounce  pasta
       2         ounce  fontina
                        salt
       2         ounce  mild provolone
                        pepper
     1/4           cup  butter
                        grated cheese

Heat half the butter in a pan. When it melts add the flour. When it begins to bubble add the milk and mix well. Cook on low for 5 min. It will start to thicken. Mix often to avoid lumping and sticking. Cut all the cheese into small strips. Gradually add the cheese mixing well while it melts into a velvety sauce. Season with salt and pepper and serve over hot, cooked pasta of your choice. Top with grated cheese. **You may vary some of the cheeses, but never the Fontina. That is the essential flavor.
