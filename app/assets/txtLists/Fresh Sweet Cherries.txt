 Select moisture-proof containers with lids that are thoroughly clean.

 Work with a small amount of cherries at a time to allow for quick handling and prompt freezing.

 Wash cherries in ice water and drain.  Pack according to preferred method and freeze immediately.

 To freeze whole with stems, pack washed cherries with stems intact in freezer containers.  Shake containers to pack cherries closely.  Cover tightly and freeze.

 For a syrup pack, make a syrup by boiling 1 cup sugar with 2 cups water until sugar dissolves.  Refrigerate until syrup is ice cold.  It takes 1/2 to 2/3 cup syrup for each pint container of cherries.  Add 1/2 Tsp. ascorbic acid per pint of cherries.  Pour about 1/2 cup ice cold syrup into container.  Fill half full with pitted fresh sweet cherries.  Shake container to pack fruit as closely as possible with crushing.  Finish filling container with cherries, leaving 1/2 inch headspace for half pints and pints; 3/4 inch for 1 1/2 pints.  If needed, add more syrup to cover cherries.  Place small pieces of crumpled plastic wrap or aluminum foil on top of fruit, dressing down; to hold cherries under syrup.  Cover tightly and freeze.

 For dry sugar pack, fill freezing containers with pitted or unpitted fresh sweet cherries.  Shake container to pack cherries closely.  Pour 1/3 cup sugar over each pint of cherries.  Cover tightly and freeze.
