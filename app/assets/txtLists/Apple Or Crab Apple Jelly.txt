       5        Pounds  Apples -- to make
       7          Cups  Apple Juice
       5          Cups  Water
       9          Cups  Sugar
       1           Box  Fruit Pectin
     1/2      Teaspoon  Butter

TO PREPARE APPLES FOR JUICE:  Remove stems and blossoms ends.  Cut into small pieces (do not peel or core).  Place in large saucepan.  Add water.  Bring to full boil.  Cover and simmer 10 minutes.  Crush cooked apples, cover and simmer 5 minutes longer.

Place 3 layers of damp cheesecloth or jelly bag in a large bowl.  Pour cooked fruit into cheesecloth.  Tie and hang to let drip into a bowl.  When dripping stops, press gently.  Measure juice and if necessary, add up to 1/2 cup water for exact measure.

Boil jars on rack in large pot filled with water 10 minutes.  Place flat lids in saucepan with water.  Bring to boil; remove from heat.  Let stand in hot water until ready to fill.  Drain well.

Combine juice, fruit pectin and butter.  Bring mixture to full rolling boil over high heat, stirring constantly.  Quickly add sugar to fruit mixture.  Bring to full rolling boil and boil 1 minute, stirring constantly.  Remove from heat.  Skim off any foam.

Fill all jars quickly to 1/8" of tops.  Wipe jar rims.  Cover quickly with flat lids.  Screw bands tightly.  Invert jars for 5 minutes, then turn upright.  After 1 hour check seals.  Or use water bath method.

Makes 10 cups.
