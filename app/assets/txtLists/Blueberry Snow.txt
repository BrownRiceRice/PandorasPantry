       1       package  unflavored gelatin (1 env)
     1/4           cup  cold water
     1/2           cup  boiling water
       2           cup  fresh blueberries (rinsed)
       1      teaspoon  lemon juice
       2    tablespoon  granulated sugar replacement
       2                egg whites (beaten stiff)
       6                fresh strawberries(optional)

Sprinkle gelatin over cold water in mixing bowl; set aside 10 minutes to soften.  Add boiling water and stir to completely dissolve. (If gelatin does not dissolve completely, heat slightly.) Set aside. Combine blueberries, lemon juice and sugar replacement in mixing bowl or food processor and whip into a puree. Stir completely into gelatin mixture. When blueberry mixture is cool, thick and syrupy, beat until frothy. Fold stiffly beaten egg whites into blueberry mixture. Spoon into 6 serving dishes; refrigerate until set. Before serving, top with fresh strawberries. 1 serving = 1/3 fruit calories = 18
