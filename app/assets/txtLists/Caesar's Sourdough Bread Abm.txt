                        -----best bread machine cb ever-----
   2 1/2     teaspoons  yeast
       2          cups  bread flour
       1           cup  whole wheat flour
   1 1/2                garlic cloves -- crushed
   1 1/2   tablespoons  sugar
     1/2    tablespoon  salt
     1/4           cup  parmesan -- grated
       3   tablespoons  olive oil
       4                anchovies -- chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  lemon peel -- grated
   1 1/2          cups  sourdough starter
     1/2           cup  water -- warm

Bring all ingredients to room temperature and pour into bakery, in order. Set "baking control" at 10 o'clock. Select "white bread" and push Start.

 In hot & humid weather, use 1/8 c less water.

 If Caesar made bread instead of salad dressing, this would be it. Sandwich with lettuce and tomatoes or tuna salad, or serve it with a green salad. For an hors d'oeuvre, toast slices and top with steak tartare or a sliver of rare roast beef. The crusty ends can be cut into croutons, toasted in a frying pan, and tossed in a salad.
