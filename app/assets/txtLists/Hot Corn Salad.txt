Strip fresh corn then boil briefly, then refresh in cold water to stop the cooking.  Cut off the kernels - about 3 cups.

Peel carrots; shave 3 strips from each side with a vegetable peeler and drop then into a bowl of ice and water so they will from curls.

The remains of the carrots, flat after their shaving, are seasoned with salt and pepper and slowly cooked in olive oil in a covered pan until just tender.

Shortly before serving, reheat the carrot pieces.  fold the corn kernels into the pepper mixture, add a little fresh oil and heat through.  Correct seasoning and turn into a platter, surround with the carrot curls, and serve.
