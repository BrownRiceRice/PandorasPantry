People who do not like ordinary pate seem to love this one. Vary the herbs and substitute the vegetables as you wish. Serve with water crackers, thick slices of crusty French bread, thin slices of whole wheat bread, or unsalted whole wheat crackers. May be frozen. VARIATIONS:  - Substitute other vegetables for the mushrooms (maybe broccoli.)  - Substitute 1/2 t fennel for the tarragon and 1 c whole pecans for    the almonds  - vary the flavor by using other seasonings such as basil, oregano, dillweed, curry powder, or nutmeg.
