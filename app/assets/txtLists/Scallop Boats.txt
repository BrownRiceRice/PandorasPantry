       1         pound  sea scallops -- fresh or frozen
       5         large  baking potatoes -- up to 6
       4   tablespoons  butter or margarine
       2     teaspoons  minced onion
                        Salt to taste
       1      teaspoon  dry mustard
     1/8      teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
     1/4           cup  milk
     1/4           cup  scallop broth
       1       package  frozen green peas -- cooked (10 oz.)

 Defrost scallops, if frozen.  Cover with boiling salted water; simmer 12 - 15 minutes; drain, cool, halve; save broth.

 Rub potatoes with a little butter; bake at 450 degrees for 50 to 60 minutes.  Cut in halves lengthwise; remove pulp, leaving just enough to keep shells firm.  Puree pulp with blender or put through a food mill or sieve.

 Add butter or margarine, onion, salt, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and enough milk and scallop broth to form a fairly stiff mixture.

 Stir in scallops and peas.

 Heap into potato shells.

 Heat at 350 degrees to serving temperature.

Makes 5 or 6 servings.
