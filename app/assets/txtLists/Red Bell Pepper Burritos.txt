       2     teaspoons  olive oil
       1         small  onion -- minced
       1         clove  garlic -- small
     1/2           cup  red peppers -- chopped
   1 1/2          cups  kidney beans -- canned
       1    tablespoon  mild chili peppers -- chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  cumin
     1/4      teaspoon  oregano -- dried
       8                flour tortillas
     1/2           cup  Monterey Jack cheese -- shredded

In a medium skillet, heat oil.  Add onions and garlic; cook until soft, 
about 5 minutes.  Add peppers and cook until almost tender, 5 to 10 
minutes.  Add beans, chilies, cumin and oregano.  Heat through 

Place a tortilla in a heavy 10" skillet over moderate heat and cook, 
turning frequently, until pliable.  Spread 4 tablespoons of filling down 
the center of the tortilla.  Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon of cheese, roll
up 
and place in a casserole with the seam side down.  Repeat with remaining 
tortillas.

Heat burritos in a 325 Deg. F. oven for 15 minutes.  Serve with salsa, 
hot-pepper sauce, sour cream, tomatoes and lettuce.
