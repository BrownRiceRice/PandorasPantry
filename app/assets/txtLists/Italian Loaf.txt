       1           can  refrigerated prepared pizza
       1       package  frozen spinach -- (10 oz)
                        crust dough (10 oz)
                        thawed and drained
       4           cup  mozzarella cheese -- grated
       1                egg -- lightly beaten
       1         pound  spicy pork sausage -- browned
       1      7 oz jar  diced pimientos
                        and drained
                        drained
     1/2           cup  tomato sauce
       1       package  sliced pepperoni -- 3 oz
       1      teaspoon  oregano flakes
      12         large  pimiento-stuffed green
     1/2      teaspoon  basil flakes
                        olives -- cut in half

Preheat oven to 400F.  Unroll dough and cut off one-fourth of dough crosswise; set aside.  Line a greased 9 1/4x5 1/4x2 1/2-inch loaf pan with the large piece of dough. Moisten the dough with water at corners and press to seal.  Place one-half of the cheese on the bottom of the dough and top with sausage. Spoon tomato sauce over sausage and sprinkle with oregano and basil.  Combine spinach with egg and spread over tomato sauce. Layer pimientos on top of spinach and top with remaining cheese. Arrange the pepperoni on top of the cheese layer.  Top with olive halves. Cover filling with reserved dough and crimp edges of dough to seal. Cut slits in top of dough to allow steam to escape. Bake 50 minutes or until crust is well browned (if crust browns too quickly, cover loosely with aluminum foil). Allow to cool 10 minutes before removing from pan and cutting into slices.
