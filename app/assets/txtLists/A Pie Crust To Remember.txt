--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       2          Cups  Flour
       1      Teaspoon  Salt
     3/4           Cup  Shortening
     1/2           Cup  Ice Water

Mix flour and salt.

Cut in shortening thoroughly with pastry blender.

Add ice water and blend until dough cleans bowl and is no longer sticky.

Divide into 2 balls.

Roll out on floured board, sprinkle a little flour on top of dough to make rolling easier.

Roll from center outward.

This amount makes enough for a double crust to fit a 9" pan.
