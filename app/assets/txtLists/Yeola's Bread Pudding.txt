--------  ------------  --------------------------------
      10        slices  stale bread
       3                eggs, beaten
       2          cups  sugar
     1/2           cup  oleo
       1           cup  raisins
       1           cup  pecan pieces
       1           cup  (16 oz) fruit cocktail/juice
       1           cup  pet milk (12 oz)
       1           cup  water
       2   tablespoons  vanilla butternut flavoring

Put everything in a large bowl and mix it up.  Yeola says that she uses her hands to make sure it's well blended.  Then turn into a greased 9 x 13-inch pan and bake in a 400-degree oven for 1 hour and 20 minutes. From Justin Wilson's "Outdoor Cooking with Inside Help" I've had this with a delicious Jack Daniels sauce.  I've looked high and low, but can't find the recipe.  If you're ever in Lafayette Louisiana go to Prejeans, one of the nicest Cajun restaurants around. They serve a great bread pudding there, maybe you can talk them into giving you their sauce recipe.
