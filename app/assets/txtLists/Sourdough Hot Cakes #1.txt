 The yarns about Alaska's famous sourdough are as big as the country.  "Sourdough Pete," so the legend goes, first brought it from Michigan at the turn of the century.  The old-time prospectors and pioneers, nicknamed "sourdoughs," wore their precious sourdough starter in a bag inside their shirts and slept with it under the covers to keep it from freezing.  Trappers not only considered it their "staff of life" for the hot cakes, waffles, muffins and bread it made; they also used it for tanning hides!
