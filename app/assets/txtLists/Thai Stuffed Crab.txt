     1/2    tablespoon  chpd cilantro roots (subst. -- 2 tsp chopped stems)
       3   tablespoons  golden mount or maggi sauce
       1                jumbo egg
       8                cleaned and dried crab shells

*Poo Jah DIRECTIONS: Combine crab meat, pork, shrimps, garlic, pepper, cilantro roots, and Golden Mount sauce well. Stuff in each crab shell and pack tightly. Sprinkle cilantro leaves and red chilies. Smooth the surface and press down securely. Bring a lot of water to a rapid boil in a steamer. Arrange in the stuffed crab shells. Place several layers of paper towels on top of the steamer, NOT the food and replace the cover. Steam for 20 minutes and remove from heat. Cool. Beat the egg in a small bowl. In a large wok, heat lots of oil over medium-high heat. Dip the stuffed crab in the egg and fry meat side down until golden brown. Remove from oil and drain well. Cool slightly and serve immediately. Serve with Thai Sriracha chili sauce as an appetizer. Makes 4 servings. NOTE: Do not fry the crab too long as the stuffing will shrink and fall out of the shell.
