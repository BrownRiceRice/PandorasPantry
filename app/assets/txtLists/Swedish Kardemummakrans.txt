--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1       package  active dry yeast
     1/4           cup  warm water
   2 1/2           cup  warm milk
     3/4           cup  butter -- melted and cooled
       1            lg  egg
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
       1           cup  sugar
   1 1/2      teaspoon  cardamom -- ground
       8           cup  all purpose flour (approx.)
                        red or green candied
                        cherries -- halved (opt.)
                        lemon icing-
       2           cup  powdered sugar
     1/4           cup  milk
       1      teaspoon  lemon extract

In a large bowl, sprinkle yeast over warm water and let stand for about 5 minutes to soften.  Stir in milk, butter, egg, salt, sugar, and cardamom until blended. With spoon, stir in 7 cups of the flour or enough to form a stiff dough.  Knead about 10 minutes until smooth and elastic, adding more flour as needed to prevent sticking.  Place dough in greased bowl, grease top, cover and let rise in a warm place until almost doubled (1-1/2 to 2 hours). Punch dough down and knead briefly on floured board to release air. Divide into 6 equal portions; pull each into a rope about 24 inches long. Place 3 ropes on a greased baking sheet, pinch tops together, and braid loosely.  Form braid into a ring, pinching ends together.  Repeat to make a second braided wreath.  Cover and let rise until almost doubled (about 40 minutes). Bake in a 350  oven until loaves are medium brown (35 to 40 minutes). Transfer loaves to a rack and let cool for 10 minutes, then serve warm. Or, if made ahead, let cool completely, then wrap airtight and freeze. Thaw unwrapped.  To reheat, wrap in foil and heat in a 350 degree oven for about 20 minutes. To serve, spoon half the Lemon Icing around top of each wreath, letting it drizzle down sides.  Decorate with cherries, if desired.
