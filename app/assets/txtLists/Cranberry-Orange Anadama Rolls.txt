--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1 1/2          cups  cranberry juice
     1/2           cup  yellow cornmeal
       4   tablespoons  unsalted butter -- at room temp
     1/3           cup  dark molasses
       2   tablespoons  dark molasses
       1             t  salt
       1       package  dry yeast
     1/2             c  warm water
       1             c  whole-wheat flour
   2 1/2             c  cranberries -- fresh, whole
                        zest of 1 orange, grated
       4             c  all-purpose flour -- up to 5 cups
       1                egg -- lightly beat w/ 1 T
                        additional cornmeal for tops of rolls

In a small saucepan, heat cranberry juice to a simmer and gradually stir in the cornmeal [whisk constantly to avoid lumps]. Reduce heat to low and stir the mixture continuously with a wooden spoon [whisk] until the mixture is thick and smooth like porridge, 5 to 7 minutes [this took more like 10 minutes, and there were still lumps, but they were incorporated when the dough was mixed together later]. Add 1/3 c of molasses [I used 1/4c] and the salt and set aside to cool to lukewarm.

Meanwhile, dissolve yeast in lukewarm water in a large mixing bowl for 10 minutes. Stir in the whole wheat flour and the cooled cornmeal  mixture.

Place cranberries, orange zest and remaining molasses [I left out this molasses] in a food processor and pulse several times until berries are coarsely chopped (or chop by hand). Add to dough mixture and stir thoroughly. Add the all-purpose flour to make a soft dough. [I added more than 5 cups and it was still sticky--keep in mind it will stay sticky, and just add enough to make it manageable.] Knead for 10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Place in a greased bowl, turn to grease the top, and cover. Let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours [I put it in the refrigerator at this point and finished them the next morning].

Punch down and turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Tear off pieces of the dough and shape into smooth balls, about 2" in diam. Place 2" apart on lightly greased cookie sheets. Let rise in a warm spot until doubled in bulk, 30-45 minutes.

Preheat oven to 375F. Brush all over with the egg wash and sprinkle tops lightly with cornmeal. Bake 20 minutes or until golden brown.

Note:  The book says this yields 18 rolls. I made dough balls the size of golf balls and ended up with about 30 rolls the size of small dinner rolls.
