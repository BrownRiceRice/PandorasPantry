       6                manicotti noodles, *cooked
                        rinsed & drained*
     1/2       package  frozen chopped spinach
                        *thawed and squeezed
                        dry(er)*
     1/2           cup  white mushrooms
     1/2           cup  shitake mushrooms
     1/2           cup  onion
     1/2           cup  pepper -- *sauteed in red
                        wine -- open a nice bottle &
                        drink the rest*
       1           cup  fatfree cottage cheese (or
                        that dryer kind of cottage
                        cheese)
       4        cloves  garlic sauteed w/ the
                        rest of the stuff
                        i forgot!
                        italian herbs to taste
     1/2           cup  fatfree parmesan

All measurings except the six noodles (which serves 2) are approximate. Really, I guess you can put in about anything you like.  I left the mushrooms out of Ben's because he's weird that way.  Anyway, stuff this mixture into the shells. You may have some left over. So sue me.  Put them in a baking dish and pour one jar of Healthy Choice f/f spaghetti sauce over the noodles.   Bake at 400 F for about 45 minutes.  This is very easy and I hope you like it as well as we do. Mangia!
