--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1 1/2          cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  powdered sugar
     3/4           cup  butter or margarine -- cold
       1    tablespoon  cornstarch
       3   tablespoons  amaretto -- to 4 tablespoons
      14        ounces  sweetened condensed milk
       1           cup  semisweet chocolate chips
   1 1/2          cups  sweetened coconut flakes
     1/2           cup  almonds -- sliced

Preheat oven to 350 degrees; grease a 13 x 9 x 2-inch baking pan.  In a large bowl, combine the flour and sugar. With a pastry blender or 2 knives, cut in the butter until crumbly.  Press the mixture firmly in the prepared pan. Bake for 20 minutes.  Meanwhile, in a small bowl, stir the cornstarch into the amaretto until dissolved; stir in the condensed milk.  Pour the mixture evenly over the prebaked crust.  Top with the chocolate chips, coconut and almonds; press down firmly.  Bake for 25 to 30 minutes longer, or until golden brown.  Cool in the pan on a wire rack. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
