--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       2         large  hard-boiled eggs
       1           cup  avocado -- mashed
       1  6 1/2 oz can  tuna (in water)
       2   tablespoons  dill relish
       2     teaspoons  Louisiana hot sauce
     1/2           cup  onion -- chopped
       2   tablespoons  mayonnaise (maybe 3 tbs)
                        fresh lemon juice

Peel eggs and mash real well with a regular dinner fork (more or less mince them).  Peel avocado and squeeze 1/2 lemon on it to keep from discoloring. Then mash real well with fork. Mix these two ingredients real well. Drain water from tuna and mix with onions, eggs, avocado, dill pickles or relish, salt, Louisiana hot sauce, and mayonnaise.  Serve over lettuce.
