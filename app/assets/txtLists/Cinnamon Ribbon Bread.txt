--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   2 3/4          cups  all-purpose flour
   2 1/2     teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     3/4           cup  butter or margarine
   1 1/4          cups  sugar -- divided
       3                eggs
   1 1/2     teaspoons  vanilla extract
       1           cup  sour cream
       2      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/2           cup  pecans -- chopped

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Combine flour, balking powder, and salt in a small bowl until well blended. In a large bowl, beat butter and 1 cup of the sugar until creamy and light. Beat in eggs, one at a time and vanilla until well blended. Beat in flour mixture and sour cream, alternately, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. In a small bowl, combine remaining 1/4 cup sugar and the cinnamon. Spoon about one third of the batter into greased and floured 9 x 5-inch loaf pan. Sprinkle with one third of the cinnamon mixture. Repeat with remaining batter and cinnamon mixture until all is used up. Sprinkle the top of the bread with pecans, pressing them in slightly with your fingers. Bake 50 to 55 minutes, or until a wooden pick inserted in the middle comes out clean. Cool bread 10 minutes in the pan on a wire rack. Remove from pan and cool completely on rack.
