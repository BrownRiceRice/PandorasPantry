In a food processor or blender, blend the tuna*, cottage cheese, lemon juice, mayo, oil, parsley, tarragon and mustard until smooth. Chill. To serve, arrange vegetables on a platter. Use to dip in the tuna mixture. As a change of pace, use this dip as a spread on toasted pita wedges. * Variations:  Replace the tuna with canned salmon. Substitute your choice of raw veggies such as whole asparagus, cauliflower, zucchini, or jicama.
