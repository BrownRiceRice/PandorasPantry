       4    tablespoon  butter
     1/4           cup  dry marsala
       4                chicken breast halves
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
       4                shallots -- finely chopped

* Skin and bone the chicken breasts then, using the flat (smooth) side of a meat mallet, pound the breasts to 1/4 inch thickness. In a large frying pan, melt 2 T. butter over medium heat. Add chicken and saute', turning once, until lightly browned about 2 minutes on each side. Remove and set aside. Melt remaining butter in pan. Add shallots and mushrooms. Cook until mushrooms are lightly browned, 3-5 minutes. Add Marsala and bring to a boil, scraping up any browned bits from bottom of pan. Add cream and lemon juice and return to a boil. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Return chicken to pan and cook, turning in sauce, for about 3 minutes to reheat and finish cooking.
