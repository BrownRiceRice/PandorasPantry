       2                chicken breasts
     1/2           cup  cornstarch
       2     teaspoons  salt
       1      teaspoon  sugar
   1 1/2   tablespoons  dry white wine
       2                egg whites
   1 1/2          cups  finely chopped almonds -- or walnuts, peanuts,
                        peanut oil -- for frying

Bone chicken breasts.  Slice into thin slices (easier to do if boneless chicken breasts have been partially frozen).  Mix corn starch, salt and sugar.  Add wine and mix thoroughly.

Beat egg white lightly and add gradually, stirring constantly into the cornstarch mixture.  Spread chopped nuts on a flat working surface.  Dip thin slices of chicken into cornstarch mixture and coat both sides with nuts.  Set aside until all chicken slices are prepared.

In deep fry pan heat oil until hot.  Add chicken and cook very quickly.  Do not overcook, just barely golden brown.  Drain and serve immediately.
