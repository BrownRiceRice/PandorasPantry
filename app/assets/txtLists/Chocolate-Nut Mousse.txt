       4        ounces  sweet cooking chocolate -- melted and cooled
     1/4           cup  finely chopped nuts
       4                Eggs -- separated

                        Whipped cream -- optional
                        Chocolate Curls -- optional

 Combine chocolate and nuts; set aside.

 Beat egg whites and salt in large bowl of mixer at high speed until stiff but not dry; set aside.

 Beat egg yolks in small bowl of mixer until thick and lemon-colored, then stir in chocolate-nut mixture.

 Fold into whites until very well blended.

 Spoon into 4 individual dessert dishes.

 Chill at least 2 hours.

 Serve with dollop of whipped cream garnished with chocolate curls.

Makes 4 servings.

CHOCOLATE CURLS:  Hold wrapped square or bar of semisweet, sweet or milk chocolate in hands to warm slightly.  Unwrap and with vegetable peeler or small sharp knife shave chocolate in long thin strokes to form curls.  Shave directly onto dessert.  (NOTE:  unsweetened chocolate can be used but is more brittle and harder to shave.)
