CRUST: To make crust, mix flour, sugar, and lemon rind.  Cut in butter or margarine until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Add egg yolk and 1 T of milk; mix gently to form a dough.  Pat into bottom of a 10-inch Springform pan that has sides only greased.  Press dough up sides of pan for 1 inch.

Stir in milk and reserved rum. Pour custard over apples and bake for 45 to 60 minutes at 350 degrees F. until custard is set.  Cool completely before serving.  Do NOT remove springform pan until cool.
