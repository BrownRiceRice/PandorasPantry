       2                european cucumbers -- (about 1 3/4 lb), un
       3   tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly ground pepper
     1/3           cup  heavy cream

Halve the cucumbers lengthwise using a large knife. Scrape out the seeds with a spoon and discard. Cut each half crossways into 1/4 inch slices and set aside. In a large skillet, melt the butter over moderate heat. Add the cucumbers, salt and pepper, cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until the cukes are tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in the cream and cook until slightly reduced and thickened, about 2 minutes.
