     1/2       package  medium noodles
       1         pound  ground beef
       1         pound  italian sausage (mild)
       1           jar  pizza sauce
     1/2           jar  spaghetti sauce
                        butter
     1/4         pound  thinly sliced pepperoni
     1/2           cup  shredded mozzarella
     1/4           cup  grated sharp cheddar cheese
                        garlic powder

Boil a half bag of medium noodles. Brown one pound hamburger and one pound sausage. Drain noodles and in a bowl mix hamburger, sausage and mix in one jar pizza sauce and half a jar spagetti sauce. Grease a baking dish with butter; (only a thin coat). Spoon in meat mixture. Top with pepperoni, mozzarella cheese, and sharp cheddar cheese. On top of that sparkle lightly with garlic powder. Put in oven on 350 degree's and bake until cheese melts. It taste like a pizza lasagne. Let me know how you like it.
