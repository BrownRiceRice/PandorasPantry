     1/4         ounce  active dry yeast
   1 1/4          cups  warm water
     1/2           cup  olive oil
       4          cups  bread flour
       1      teaspoon  salt
                        chopped fresh rosemary -- tarragon and oregano
                        for the filling
       2        ounces  pesto
     1/4         pound  ham -- thinly sliced
     1/4         pound  provolone cheese -- sliced
     1/8         pound  coppacola (spicy italian -- ham) thinly sliced
       2                sweet red peppers, roasted -- peeled and sliced
       2        ounces  pepperoncinis -- drained and
                        (6            - 8)
       1                egg
       1                egg white
                        cornmeal

For the Pizza Dough Soften the yeast in the water. Stir in the oil, then the flour and salt. Knead dough on a floured board until smooth and elastic (about 20 minutes). Shape into a round ball, cover with plastic and refrigerate 1 hour. Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Shape the pizza dough into a ball and then roll out into a large oval shape (about 24 inches long). About 2 inches behind the front edge, spread the pesto in a long stripe, stopping just short of the ends. Just behind and overlapping the pesto, place a layer of the ham slices, then a layer of cheese then the coppacolla, peppers and pepperoncini. You should still have about 2 inches of dough showing at the back edge. Beat the egg and brush on the back edge and ends of the dough. Roll up Calzone as firmly as possible (so no air gets inside). Tuck the ends in and finish with the back edge on the bottom, not on the side. Place on a baking sheet pan sprinkled with corn meal, brush with egg white and bake in a 400 degree oven for 20 minutes. Cool to room temperature and slice.  Can be sliced thin for appetizers NOTE: To roast peppers, preheat broiler.  Slice the peppers in half lengthwise. Core them and remove the seeds and ribs. Lay the pieces skin side up on a flat broiling pan and place the pan 3 - 4 inches below the heat.  Broil the peppers until the skins are charred (they should be black).  Then place the peppers in a plastic bag, seal it with a twist tie and set aside.  Let peppers steam in the bag for 15 minutes. Remove the peppers from the bag and slip off the charred skins.
