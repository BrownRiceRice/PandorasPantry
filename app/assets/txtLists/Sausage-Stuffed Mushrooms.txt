--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1         pound  small fresh white mushrooms
       2   tablespoons  vegetable oil -- divided
       1                (about 3.5 ounces) hot Italian sausage -- casing removed
     1/4           cup  finely chopped onion
     1/4           cup  finely chopped sweet red or green bell peppers
       1    tablespoon  dried Italian flavored bread crumbs

Heat oven to 400 degrees. Remove mushroom stems; chop enough to make 1/2 cup; reserve. In a medium bowl, place caps, toss with 1 tablespoon of the oil. On a shallow baking pan, arrange mushroom caps, cavity side down; bake until tender, about 10 minutes. In a small skillet, over medium heat, heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil.

Add sausage, onion, pepper and reserved chopped stems; cook and stir, breaking sausage into smaller pieces with a fork, until cooked through, about 5 minutes. Add liquid collected in the baking pan to the sausage mixture; cook until all liquid has evaporated.

Remove from heat; stir in breadcrumbs. Turn mushrooms over, stuff with sausage mixture. Bake until stuffing is browned, about 10 minutes, serve hot.
