       1           cup  quick cooking barley
     2/3           cup  chopped parsley

Tips:  This dish can be assembled and baked later.  Add the boiling water just before baking.  Baking time should be increased by 15 minutes when starting refrigerated temperature.

 *  Green pepper cut into strips. ** 15-1/2 oz. cans each.

 Heat oil in a large skillet.  Add onion, celery, and green pepper. Cook slowly for 10 minutes.  Do not brown. Stir in tomatoes, kidney beans, barley, parsley, salt, basil, and black pepper. Transfer mixture to a buttered 2-to 3 quart casserole with lid.  Add boiling water.  Cover. Bake at 350 degrees F for 1-1/2 hours or until barley is tender and liquid is absorbed.  Sprinkle with grated cheese before serving.

 Good served with:  Marinated, slightly blanched mixed vegetables, hot French bread and butter.
