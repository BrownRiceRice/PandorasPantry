For each cup of vegetable stock specified in recipe, dissolve 1 teaspoon vegetable-flavored granules or 1 cube vegetable stock base in 1 cup boiling water.

Cut in matchstick pieces, or 1/2 cup sliced water chestnuts. (including tops) Cut into 1-inch diagonal slices. Cover mushrooms with water and let stand for 30 minutes.  Remove mushrooms; cut off and discard stems.  Thinly slice mushrooms and set aside.  Measure soaking water (discard any sandy portion at the bottom) and add enough stock to make a total of 4 cups liquid.  Place in a 2-quart pan and add sherry, bamboo shoots, and sliced mushrooms.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat; cover and simmer for 15 minutes.  Add tofu, peas, white vinegar, and soy; heat for 3 minutes. In a small bowl, stir together cornstarch and the 1/4 cup water.  Add to soup and cook, stirring, until slightly thickened.  Turn off heat.  Add pepper and sesame oil.  Stirring continuously, slowly pour egg into soup. Sprinkle with onion; add salt to taste.
