When foaming subsides reduce heat and stir in flour. Don't brown. Remove from heat and slowly pour in reduced poaching liquid and milk while stirring vigorously. Return to heat and bring to boil with continuous stirring. Cook for 1 minute. Whisk cream and eggs together in bowl. Add two tbs hot sauce to mixture with stirring then add 2 more. Slowly add egg mixture to sauce with stirring, bring to boil for 30 seconds. Remove from heat add one or two tsp lemon juice, ground pepper and 1 tsp chicken base. Remove excess liquid from bowl containing scallops. Stir in a little over 1/2 of the sauce and mix gently. Butter 6 shallow 4 inch baking dishes. Spoon in scallops and cover with remaining sauce. Heat in 375 deg oven for about 10 minutes. Mix topping ingredients together, sprinkle over scal lops and place under broiler until topping is slightly brown. Use 8 inch casserole if you don't have individual baking dishes.
