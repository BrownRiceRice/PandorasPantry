--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   2 1/2          cups  all-purpose flour
   1 1/2          cups  granulated sugar
     3/4           cup  coconut flakes
       1           cup  butter -- softened
       2                eggs
   1 1/2     teaspoons  cream of tartar
       1      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
       1    tablespoon  lemon juice
     1/2      teaspoon  lemon peel -- grated

 Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  In a large mixer bowl, combine all ingredients.  Beat at low speed, scraping the bowl often, for 2 to 4 minutes until well mixed.  Drop rounded teaspoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto ungreased cookie sheets.  Bake for 7 to 10 minutes, or until the edges are lightly browned.  Remove from the pans immediately.
