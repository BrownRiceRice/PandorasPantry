--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       2        pounds  cornstarch
   3 3/4          cups  water
                        green food coloring

Add food coloring to the water to desired color, stir into the cornstarch. When the cornstarch is dissolved, drop the whole batch onto a tray for the child to play with.

This is almost a liquid, so makes a fun change from other doughs. Clean up is the easiest of all doughs, as when it dries it is simply swept up.

Any that is left can be placed in a clean glass jar and let dry. It can then be reconstituted by simply adding water.
