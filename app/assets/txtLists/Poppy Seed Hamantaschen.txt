--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       6          cups  all-purpose flour -- divided
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
       1      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2           cup  shortening
       5                eggs -- divided
       1           cup  honey
                        ---poppy seed filling---
       2          cups  poppy seeds
       1           cup  milk
     3/4           cup  honey
       1      teaspoon  lemon peel
     1/2           cup  raisins

Combine 5 cups flour, salt and baking powder; mix well.  Make a well in the center and add shortening, 4 eggs and honey.  Work  together until dough is formed, adding flour as needed. 

Roll out thinly and cut into 4-inch circles.  Place 1 tablespoon filling on each; fold up three sides and press together into triangles, leaving tops somewhat open.  Beat remaining egg and brush over dough.  Bake at 350F for 20 minutes or until browned.

Filling: Grind the poppy seeds; combine with the milk and honey.  Cook over low heat until thickened.  Add 1 teaspoon lemon peel and 1/2 cup raisins.  Cool.
