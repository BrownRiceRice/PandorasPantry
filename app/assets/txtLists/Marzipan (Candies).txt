Nothing expresses the German love of edible art more succinctly than marzipan candies, which are shaped into piglets, cats, poodles, flowers, fruit and all sorts of other objects. They are delicious to eat, too. Carefully dry the shelled almonds, then grind to a powder in an electric blender, if you have one. Blend almonds, the sugar, the egg white and just enough rosewater or orangewater (available from pharmacies) to make a pliable stiff dough. Knead with fingers, then place on board dusted with confectioners' sugar and form into desired shapes, to resemble miniature apples, peaches, strawberries or, if you have an artist's touch, little pigs or birds. Tint with (65 min left), (H)elp, More? food coloring. Balls of marzipan may be rubbed in chocolate dots or colored sugar. If dough becomes too stiff, work in a little lemon juice, rosewater or orangewater, adding drop by drop. When candies are shaped, dry thoroughly in a cool, airy place for 24 hours, then wrap separately or place in a container (such as a little straw basket for fruit) and cover completely with Saran or other plastic wrap. Makes 2 pounds of candy.
