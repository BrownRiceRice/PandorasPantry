Place in bowl and set aside. Pour off all but 2 T oil and add seasonings and brown. Stir in sauce until bubbles. Return shrimp. Add sesame oil.

 This recipe is absolutely sensational.  However it does not make alot of sauce for rice.  I usually double the sauce ingredients. It is very hot. If you like food milder leave out some chilis. I have tried the General Taos chicken posted here on prodigy. My family prefers this recipe. My last attempt to post this recipe failed. Sorry for the inconvenience.
