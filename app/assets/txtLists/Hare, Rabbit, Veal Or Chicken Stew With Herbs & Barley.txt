--------  ------------  --------------------------------
      50         grams  butter
   1 1/2     kilograms  hare or rabbit joints -- stewing veal or chic
     450         grams  leeks -- thickly sliced
       4        cloves  garlic -- chopped finely
     175         grams  pot barley
     900            ml  water
       3   tablespoons  wine vinegar
       2                bay leaves
                        salt, pepper
      15                fresh sage -- roughly chopped

In 7th century England, herbs were one of the few flavourings available to cooks and were used heavily... Melt the butter in a heavy pan and fry the meat with the leeks and garlic till the vegetables are slightly softened and the meat lightly browned. Add the barley, water, vinegar, bay leaves and seasoning. bring the pot to the boil, cover it and simmer gently for 1 - 1 1/2 hours or till the meat is really tender and ready to fall from the bone. Add the sage and continue to cook for several minutes.  Adjust the seasoning to taste and serve in bowls-- the barley will serve as a vegetable.
