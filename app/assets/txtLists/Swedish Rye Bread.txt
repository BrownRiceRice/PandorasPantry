       2          cups  milk
       1           cup  water
     1/2           cup  brown sugar
     1/2         ounce  dry yeast -- two packages
       6          cups  rye flour -- approximate
       3          cups  white flour -- approximate
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil
     1/4           cup  dark molasses
       2     teaspoons  anise seed -- crushed
       1      teaspoon  salt

Scald the milk and combine it with the water and brown sugar in a very large bowl.  (You need something that holds at least 4 or 5 quarts.) When the mixture is lukewarm, dissolve the yeast in it, then stir in 2 cups rye flour and 1 cup white flour to make a paste.

Let the mixture rise in a warm place until it is light and foamy. This usually takes about 30 minutes to an hour.  Check it frequently-it can really make a mess if it rises enough to overflow the bowl.  (I'm sure they could make a great horror movie about a gigantic blob of bread dough that keeps getting bigger and bigger as it consumes everything in its path....)

Stir in the granulated sugar, oil, molasses, anise seed and salt, and enough flour to make a stiff dough, using 2 parts rye to 1 part white. Knead the dough for about 5 minutes, or until it is smooth and elastic, adding more flour to keep it from sticking to your hands.

Clean and grease the bowl.  Put the dough in the bowl, turning it to grease all sides.  Cover the bowl loosely with a clean towel and let the dough rise until it's doubled in bulk.  Punch it down and let rise until double again.

Divide the dough into three loaves and put in greased pans.  (I usually make round loaves and bake them on cookie sheets.)  Cover with the towel and let rise until double again.

Bake for about 45 minutes at 350 deg. F.  Because of the high sugar content, this bread can burn rather easily; watch it closely so it doesn't get too dark.
