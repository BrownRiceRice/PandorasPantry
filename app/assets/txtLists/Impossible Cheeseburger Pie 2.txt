                        --Crust--
   1 1/2          cups  skim milk
     3/4           cup  low-fat baking mix
       2         whole  egg whites
                        --Filling--
     1/2      teaspoon  olive oil
       1         pound  ground chicken breast -- skinless, cooked
     1/2           cup  onions -- chopped
     1/2           cup  bell peppers -- chopped
     1/8      teaspoon  black pepper
       2   tablespoons  low-fat baking mix
       1    tablespoon  worcestershire sauce
       1           cup  fat-free cottage cheese
       1           cup  fat-free cheddar cheese -- grated

Preheat oven to 375. Prepare a 8" square baking pan with cooking spray and flour; set aside.

To prepare crust, combine milk, 3/4 cups baking mix, and egg whites until soft dough forms; beat vigorously. Gently smooth dough into a ball on floured surface. Knead 5 times. Roll dough 2" larger than pie pan. Ease into pie pan and flute edges; set aside.

To prepare filling, heat oil over medium heat in a skillet. Add chicken, onions, and bell peppers. Cook until chicken is no longer pink and vegetables are tender. Stir in black pepper, remaining baking mix, and worcestershire sauce. Spoon into pie crust. Pour cottage cheese over chicken mixture.

Sprinkle with cheddar cheese. Bake for 30 minutes.
