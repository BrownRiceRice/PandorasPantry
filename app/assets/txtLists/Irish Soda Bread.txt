       3          cups  all purpose flour
       1           cup  quick or old fashioned oats -- uncooked
       1    tablespoon  sugar
       1    tablespoon  caraway seed -- optional
       2     teaspoons  salt
     3/4      teaspoon  soda
     1/4      teaspoon  cream of tartar
   1 1/4          cups  buttermilk
     1/2           cup  raisins
       1    tablespoon  butter -- melted

 Heat oven to 350 degrees.

 Combine ingredients except buttermilk, raisins and butter; mix well.

 Gradually stir in buttermilk and raisins, mixing just until dry ingredients are moist.

 Knead on lightly floured surface about 1 minute or until smooth.  Shape dough into a ball.  Place on well greased cookie sheet; flatten to form 7-inch circle.  Cut a cross into loaf, 1/4 inch deep.

 Bake at 350 degrees about 45 minutes or until light golden brown.

 Brush with butter.  Remove to wire cooling rack.  Cool completely.
