      14   tablespoons  butter
      12                sole fillets -- thick
                        salt
                        pepper
       1         small  onion -- finely chopped
   1 1/2          cups  champagne
       6   tablespoons  cream -- fresh
       4                egg yolks

Put 1 or 2 tablespoons butter in a large, flat skillet or heatproof baking dish.  Melt.  Add fillets of sole.  Sprinkle with salt, pepper and onion.  Pour in champagne.  Bring slowly to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer gently for 6 to 8 minutes or until tender.

When cooked, remove fillets from broth very carefully, using a wide spatula.  Try not to break fillets.  Place fillets in serving dish and keep warm in a low oven.

Put remaining butter in pan with cooking liquid.  Melt.

Use a wire whisk or wooden spoon to mix the cream and egg yolks together.  Then blend into the butter mixture, stirring constantly.  Heat sauce but do not boil.  Pour over warm fillets and serve.
