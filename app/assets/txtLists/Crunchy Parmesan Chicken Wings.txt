--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       4        pounds  chicken wings
     1/2           cup  flour
     1/2      teaspoon  paprika
     1/4      teaspoon  salt and pepper
       4                eggs
       2          cups  parmesan cheese -- freshly grated
     1/2           cup  dry bread crumbs
       1      teaspoon  dried basil and oregano

Remove tips from chicken wings and reserve for stock if desired; separate wings at joints.  In shallow dish, combine flour, paprika, salt and pepper. In another shallow dish, beat eggs. In third shallow dish, combine cheese, bread crumbs, basil and oregano. Dip wings into flour mixture, then into eggs, then into cheese mixture, pressing firmly. (Wings can be prepared to this point, placed on rack, covered and refrigerated for up to 4 hours.) Arrange wings on greased rimmed baking sheets.  Bake in 375F oven for 35-40 minutes, turning once, or until golden brown and crisp. Makes about 60 pieces.
