--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       4                peaches; freestone -- ripe
       1    tablespoon  amaretto liqueur
       1    tablespoon  butter
       1                egg yolk
     1/4           cup  brown sugar -- packed
       8                italian macaroons (amaretti)
     1/4           cup  almonds -- finely chopped
                        crushed

Cut peaches in half from stem to root end (don't peel). Twist to free from pit.  Place peach halves, cut side up, in a 10" well-buttered baking dish. Combine remaining ingredients.  Beat with a fork to blend well. Stuff each peach hollow with almond mixture. Bake in preheated 350 oven for 20 minutes, or until peaches are soft but still hold their shape. Serve warm. This can also be done with pears, apricots, nectarines or apples. All are very good.
