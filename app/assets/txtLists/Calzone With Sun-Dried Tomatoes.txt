                        deep-dish pizza dough
       1    tablespoon  oil from sun-dried tomatoes
       1        medium  onion -- finely chopped
       1         clove  garlic -- minced
                        or pressed
       1           cup  (8 oz) ricotta cheese
     1/4           cup  chopped sun-dried tomatoes
       2   tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
     1/4         pound  sliced prosciutto or dry
                        salami -- cut into strips
       2          cups  (1/2 lb) shredded whole-
                        milk mozzarella cheese
                        cornmeal (for baking sheet)
                        olive oil

1. Prepare Deep-Dish Pizza Dough and let it rise. 2. While dough rises, prepare filling. In a medium frying pan heat tomato oil over moderate heat; add onion and cook, stirring often, until soft but not browned. Mix in garlic, then remove from heat. 3. In a medium bowl mix ricotta cheese with dried tomatoes and parsley; stir in cooked onion mixture. 4. Divide dough into two equal portions. Roll each half out on a floured surface to a 12-inch circle. Spread half of the ricotta filling over half of each circle of dough, leaving about a 1/2-inch margin. 5. Sprinkle half of each circle with half of the prosciutto strips and 1 cup of the mozzarella cheese. Fold circles in halves over filling, moistening and pinching edges together (or pressing with tines of a fork) to seal. 6. Preheat oven to 450~ F. Sprinkle a large, greased baking sheet lightly with cornmeal. Place calzone well apart on prepared baking sheet. Let rise until puffy (12 to 15 minutes). Brush tops lightly with olive oil, then serve hot.
