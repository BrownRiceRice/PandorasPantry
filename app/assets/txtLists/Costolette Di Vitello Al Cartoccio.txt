--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       4    tablespoon  butter
                        freshly ground black pepper
     1/2         pound  mushrooms -- thinly sliced
                        to taste
       2           cup  tomatoes; peeled -- diced
       4                loin veal chops -- 1" thick
     1/2           cup  prosciutto ham -- julienne cut
       4    tablespoon  olive oil
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
       3    tablespoon  parsley -- minced
                        salt to taste

Melt butter in saucepan; saute mushrooms for 3 minutes. Add tomatoes, ham, wine salt and pepper to taste and bring to a boil, lower heat and cook for 5 minutes. Season chops with salt and pepper to taste. Heat 2 T. olive oil in skillet; brown chops on both sides. Cut 4 pieces of parchment paper large enough to completely fold over each chop. Brush the paper with remaining oil. Place a chop in center of each piece of parchment and cover with the sauce. Sprinkle each chop with parsley. Fold over the paper, sealing the edges well. Place on a baking sheet; bake in a 375F oven for 15 to 20 minutes. Serve in the paper with the top rolled back. Note: I usually place the parchment packages on a large wooden carving board and bring it to the table. You can either snip open the packages with scissors or carefully with a sharp knife. I like to remove the contents onto the dinner plate. Fried zucchini sticks go very well with this dish. Enjoy.
