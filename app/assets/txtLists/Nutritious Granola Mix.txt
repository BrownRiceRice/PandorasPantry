Granola mix: In a large bowl, combine oats, rye, wheat, wheat germ, coconut, sunflower seeds, nuts and sesame seeds. Stir until blended well. In a saucepan, combine brown sugar, water, oil, honey, molasses, salt, vanilla and cinnamon. Heat and stir until sugar is dissolved. DO NOT boil.

Pour syrup over oat mixture. Stir with a wooden spoon until syrup coats all ingredients.

Spread mixture in two 13 W 9 W 2-inch pans or on 2 large cookie sheets with raised edges. Bake in preheated 300-degree oven 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. For crunchier texture bake 7-10 minutes longer. Cool on racks.

Stir in the dried fruit that has been chopped into bite-sized pieces.

You can put this into containers and keep in cool dry place for up to 6 months. Do not refrigerate.

Yield: About 10 cups.
