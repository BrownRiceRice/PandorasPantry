--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  brewed coffee
   1 1/4          cups  half-and-half
       6        ounces  semisweet chocolate -- cut
                        into small chunks
       3   tablespoons  butter
     1/4           cup  flour
       4                egg yolks
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
       6                egg whites
     1/4      teaspoon  cream of tartar

Heat the coffee and half-and-half almost to a boil. Remove from heat and stir in the chocolate until melted. Heat the butter to bubbling. Stir in the flour thoroughly. Remove from heat and add the chocolate mixture, stirring well. Beat the egg yolks with 3 tbs. sugar and the salt until light. Stir into the chocolate mixture. Set aside to cool. Preheat oven to 400:. Beat the egg whites with the cream of tartar until soft peaks form. Add the remaining 1 tbs. sugar and beat until incorporated. Fold the egg whites into the cooled chocolate mixture. Prepare 4 individual souffle cups by buttering the bottoms and sides, then swishing 1 tsp. granulated sugar into each. Pour out any excess sugar. Place the batter in cups and bake in preheated oven for 25-30 min., or until well puffed and lightly browned. Serve immediately.
