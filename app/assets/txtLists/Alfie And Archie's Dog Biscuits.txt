--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   2 1/2          cups  whole wheat flour
     1/2           cup  powdered dry milk
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  garlic powder
       1      teaspoon  brown sugar
       6   tablespoons  meat drippings
       1                beaten egg
     1/2           cup  ice water

1.  Preheat oven to 350.  Lightly oil a cookie sheet.  Combine flour, dry milk, salt, garlic powder and sugar.  Cut in meat drippings until mixture resembles corn meal.  Mix in egg.  Add enough water so that mixture forms a ball.  Using your fingers, pat out dough onto cookie sheet to half inch thick.  Cut with cookie cutter or knife and remove scraps.  Scraps can be formed again and baked. 2.  Bake 25-30 minutes. Remove from tray and cool on rack. from:  Cookiemania
