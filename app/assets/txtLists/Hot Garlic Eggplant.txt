       1      teaspoon  chopped fresh ginger
       1      teaspoon  chopped fresh garlic
       1      teaspoon  Hot bean paste
       2     teaspoons  soy sauce
       1      teaspoon  sugar or sucanat
       1      teaspoon  salt (adjust for low sodium version)
     1/2           cup  soup stock or water
       1      teaspoon  chopped green onion

Cut eggplant into finger sized pieces-cut lengthwise, then into quarters etc. Saute with some water in a non-stick pan/wok, until soft. When soft, remove from pan.

On low heat, cook garlic, ginger, and hot bean paste for a minute, then add salt, sugar, soy sauce and stock/water.

Return eggplant to the pan and cook for about five minutes until garlic is soft and a sauce forms. If sauce is too thin, thicken with 1 teaspoon corn starch mixed with 2 teaspoons water. Serve over white/brown rice.
