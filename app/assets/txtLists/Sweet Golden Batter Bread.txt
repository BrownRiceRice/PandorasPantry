       1       package  active dry yeast
     1/4           cup  warm water
       1           cup  milk
     1/2           cup  butter or margarine
     1/2           cup  sugar
       1      teaspoon  salt
       2                eggs
       2     teaspoons  vanilla
   4 1/2          cups  bread flour

Proof Yeast in water. Heat milk and butter until butter melts. Add sugar and salt to milk. Cool to lukewarm. Blend yeast mix., milk mix., eggs, and vanilla. Mix in flour gradually. Beat until smooth. Dough will be sticky. Place in greased bowl. Cover with damp towel or plastic wrap and place in a warm place (such as in oven with pan of hottest tap water on rack below) until doubled in size, about 2 hours. Punch down and beat for 1 minute. Put dough into well greased Bundt pan and rise in warm place for about an hour. Bake in preheated 325 deg F oven for 40 to 45 min. Remove from pan and let cool slightly. Serve warm.

For Holidays: Add 3/4 cup chopped cranberries and 1 cup chopped pecans to dough after punching down. Sprinkle 1/2 cup chopped pecans into Bundt pan before putting dough into it.
