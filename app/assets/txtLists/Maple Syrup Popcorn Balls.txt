**In the North country the people make one of the aristocrats of sweets, maple syrup. It cooks down to a delicious candy, but is delicate, so watch  In a heavy saucepan put the maple syrup and butter. Cook to 260: on a candy thermometer. Remove from heat and add the vanilla. Stir well and pour over the popped corn. Shape into balls.

 Both pecans and walnuts are good with maple, it's hard to say which is better. You may wish to include a few of your favorite.
