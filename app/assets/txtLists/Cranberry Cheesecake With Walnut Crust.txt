--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1 1/2           cup  graham cracker crumbs
     1/2           cup  finely chopped walnuts
     1/4           cup  (1 stick) butter -- melted
       1           can  (16 oz.) whole cranberry
                        sauce
       3       package  (8 oz. each) cream cheese
                        softened
     3/4           cup  granulated sugar
     1/4           cup  flour
       3                eggs
       8         ounce  dairy sour cream
       2      teaspoon  vanilla extract

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  In a small bowl combine crumbs, walnuts and butter.  In the bottom of a 9-inch spring-form pan firmly press crumb mixture.  Bake until golden, 5 to 6 minutes; remove from oven; coo slightly. Spread with cranberry sauce; set aside. Reduce oven temperature to 300 degrees.  In the large bowl of an electric mixer beat cream cheese, sugar and flour until smooth. Beat in eggs, sour cream and vanilla until well blended; spread evenly over cranberry sauce. Bake until a knife inserted 1-1/2-inches from the edge comes out clean, about 1 hour; turn off oven; leave cheesecake in oven with door ajar until top is firm to the touch, about 30 minutes. Cool on a wire rack, about 1 hour. Cover and refrigerate until cold, about 4 hours. Just before serving, remove cheesecake from pan to a serving plate. Garnish with sugared cranberries, kiwi slices and mint leaves, if desired.

 NOTE: To make sugared cranberries: In a small bowl place a small amount of white corn syrup.  Add fresh cranberries, a few at a time, turning to coat; then place in a bowl of granulated sugar. Using a fork, remove cranberries from sugar and place on a plate until ready to use.
