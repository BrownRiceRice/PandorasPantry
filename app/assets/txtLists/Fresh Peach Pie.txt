  For crust #1: Mix all ingredients together and press into a 9" pie pan. Bake 15 to 20 minutes at 325F.  Cool.  OR use crust 2. For crust #2: Mix all ingredients together and press into a 10" pie pan or a large deep dish pie plate. Bake for 30 minutes at 350F. Cool.  Filling:Boil all but peaches and jello, stirring constantly until thickened. Remove from heat. Add the jello and cool in the refrigerator. Peel and slice the peaches to the cooled filling and pour into the crust. Garnish with Whipped Cream or Cool Whip. NOTE: I gave you 2 crust recipes because I prefer crust #2! Crust #1 came with the recipe. You decide which you would prefer!
