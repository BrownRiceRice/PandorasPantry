       1           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  milk
       6    tablespoon  unsalted butter
       2                eggs
   1 1/2           cup  flour
       1      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
       1                lemon rind -- grated
                        GLAZE
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  fresh lemon juice
                        LEMON ICE
       2           cup  water
       1           cup  sugar
       2    tablespoon  grated lemon rind
       1           cup  fresh lemon juice
       2                egg whites (opt)

Grease and flour a 9x5 loaf pan for each loaf of bread you are making. Combine sugar, milk, butter, and eggs; mix well. Blend in flour, baking powder, salt and grated lemon rind. Turn mixture into pan and bake 1 hour in preheated 350~ oven. Cool slightly, remove from pan, and set on foil. Meanwhile, prepare glaze. Combine sugar and lemon juice in sauce pan. Stir over low heat until sugar dissolves and glaze is hot. Pour hot glaze slowly over surface of bread. Let bread cool completely before slicing. To prepare Lemon Ice, combine water and sugar in a saucepan. Add rind and bring to a boil. Simmer 5 minutes. Let cool. Add lemon juice and stir. Pour liquid into freezer trays (two for each loaf of bread) and freeze until set, but not hard. Place in food processor or blender. If desired, add egg whites (they will make the ice smooth and white), and beat until smooth. Refreeze for about 3 hours or until firm. When ready to serve, let stand for a few minutes before scooping out. Serve bread slices with a scoop of lemon ice on the side.
