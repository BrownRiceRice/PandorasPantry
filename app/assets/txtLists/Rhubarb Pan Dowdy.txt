--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       3          cups  rhubarb -- cut in chunks
     1/2           cup  sugar
                        -----cake-----
   1 1/2          cups  flour
       2     teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  sugar
       1                egg -- well beaten
     1/2           cup  milk
     1/2           cup  butter -- melted

Stew the fruit, sweeten to taste and pour into a 9x9 cake pan. I frequently do this in the microwave. Sift dry cake ingredients together.  Mix the egg, milk and butter and stir gently into the flour mixture. Pour the cake mixture over the rhubarb and cook at 400 for 20 to 25 minutes until the top is golden brown. For a real cholesterol disaster, pour heavy cream over this while warm for serving.  It tastes great without it but I like the cream for company. The cake can be baked by itself in an 8x8 pan. Bake about 20 - 25 minutes. It makes a wonderful shortcake for fruit. The cookbook (Fanny Farmer) calls it Cottage Pudding.
