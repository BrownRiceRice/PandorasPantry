Based on the classic Korean entre made with beef short ribs, this easier-to-eat appetizer features beef sirloin. Blend the 2 tablespoons toasted sesame seed in a covered blender container till ground. Transfer to a small bowl; stir in soy sauce, sake, sesame oil and pepper. Place beef cubes in a heavy plastic bag; add marinade. Seal bag and turn to coat. Chill for 2-4 hours turning bag occasionally. Meanwhile soak wooden skewers in water for 30 minutes. Drain meat, reserving the marinade. Thread two meat cubes onto each skewer. Place skewers on the rack of an unheated broiler pan; broil 3-4" from the heat for 12-14 minutes or till done, turning once and brushing with reserved marinade. Arrange skewers on a serving plate. Sprinkle with toasted white and black sesame seed. Serve with White Radish Relish. Makes 18 servings.
