       2          cups  milk
                        Salt
       4        pounds  green bananas -- halved crosswise
     2/3           cup  balsamic vinegar
                        Ground black pepper
   1 2/3          cups  olive oil
       1           cup  Kalamata olives -- pitted, quartered
       4                bay leaves

TO PREPARE: Bring milk and 2 quarts water to boil in a soup kettle. Add 1 tablespoon salt and bananas. Bring to boil and simmer until bananas are cooked but still firm, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain, peel, and cut bananas, crosswise, into 1/2-inch thick slices.

Mix vinegar and 1 tablespoon pepper in a large nonreactive bowl. Whisk in oil in a slow, steady stream. Stir in olives, bay leaves, and banana slices. Let stand at room temperature at least 1 hour, then serve.

(Can be refrigerated overnight.)
