       5                eggs -- separated
     3/4           cup  sugar
       6   tablespoons  water
   1 3/4          cups  cake flour -- sifted
       1      teaspoon  baking powder
   1 1/2          cups  hazelnuts (filberts) -- ground
       1      teaspoon  vanilla extract
       2   tablespoons  confectioners' sugar
       1           cup  heavy cream -- whipped
                        fresh strawberries

Beat the egg yolks and sugar until very light, about 5 minutes. Slowly add the water.  Sift the flour and baking powder together.  Mix with 1 cup of nuts.  Fold the flour mixture into the egg yolks.  Beat the egg whites until soft peaks form.  Gently fold the beaten whites into the batter.  Pour into a greased and floured 10-inch springform pan.  Bake at 375 degrees F for 30 minutes or until cake is done. Cool cake on a wire rack.  When completely cooled, split the cake into 2 layers.  Fold the vanilla, confectioners' sugar, and remaining 1/2 cup of nuts into the whipped cream.  Spread whipped cream between the 2 cake layers and on top of the cake.  Chill until serving time. Garnish with fresh strawberries, if desired. *  Hazelnuts are available at most stores under the name of Filberts. They should be blanched.  To blanch, boil the nuts for 5 minutes and when they are cool enough to handle, remove the skins.  To grind, place about 1/4 cup at a time in a blender, or chop as finely as you can with a sharp knife.
