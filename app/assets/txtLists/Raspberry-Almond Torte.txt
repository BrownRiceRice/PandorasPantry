       1       package  yellow cake mix
       1       package  instant vanilla pudding
       4                eggs
     3/4           cup  water
     1/4           cup  oil
     1/2      teaspoon  almond extract
     1/2           cup  chopped toasted almonds
       2          cups  red raspberry preserves
       1           cup  sliced almonds
                        confectioners sugar

Combine first six ingredients in large mixer bowl. Beat at medium speed for 4 minutes. Stir in chopped almonds. Pour into 2 greased and floured 9 inch cake pans. Bake at 350:F for 30-35 min until cake is done.DO NOT UNDERBAKE. Cool in pans 15 min. Remove from pans and cool on rack. Split each layer horizontally, making 4 layers. For each torte, spread 2/3 cup preserves on 1 layer, sprinkle with 1/2 cup of the almonds. Add second layer. Spread with 1/3 cup of the preserves and sprinkle generously with confectioners sugar and additional almonds. Makes 2 tortes. If you only want 1 torte, one layer can be frozen and used later; just use half the preserves and almonds for 1 torte.
