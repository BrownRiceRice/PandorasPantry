       5                zucchini
       2        cloves  garlic -- minced
       1           tsp  butter
       1           tsp  flour

                        roman or asiago cheese -- grated (optional)

Grate the zucchini into a colander and sprinkle with salt.  Place the colander over a pan to collect the juices and let sit for 30-60 minutes.  After this period, squeeze zucchini over the colander to get the last of the juice.

Heat some butter, olive oil, or peanut oil in a frying pan and saute the zucchini and garlic for 2-3 minutes.  Meanwhile, heat zucchini juices to near boiling point.

Make a well in the center of the zucchini and heat the butter/Crisco for a few seconds, the add flour to the well.  Stir the flour and butter/Crisco together.  After 1 minute, add the hot zucchini juices and stir for 30 seconds to get a thick sauce.

Mix it all together and add pepper and cheese (if desired).
