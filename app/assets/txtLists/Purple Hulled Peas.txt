     1/4         pound  salt pork
   1 1/2        pounds  fresh purple hulled peas
                        Cold water

     1/4                Hot pepper -- optional

 Cut slits in washed and dried salt pork.

 In medium sized saucepan cover meat with about a quart of cold water.  Boil, covered, until meat is tender and water has evaporated down to about a cupful.  Add another quart of cold water to the meat.

 Add peas, bacon grease, sugar, onion and hot pepper.  Bring to a boil, cover again and lower fire to medium low.

 When peas have become slightly tender - about 30 minutes - add salt.

 Continue cooking until tender and tasty, usually about 20 minutes.

Serves 6 - 8.
