       2   tablespoons  green onions -- chopped

SERVE AS A VEGETABLE MAIN COURSE.  WHILE THE SQUASH IS BAKING YOU'LL HAVE MORE THAN ENOUGH TIME TO MAKE A TOMATO SALAD.

1. Preheat the oven to 400F.  Cut the squash in half lengthwise and scoop the seeds out of each half with a teaspoon. 

2. Mix together the corn, cottage cheese, salt, pepper, and green onions. Spoon the mixture into the squash halves, mounding it slightly.  Top with Parmesan cheese. 

3. Place the squash in a buttered 8 x 8 x 2 baking dish and bake, uncovered for 15 minutes, or until the squash is tender and the cheese topping has melted.
