* Chop apricots or use 1/3 cup candied fruits. In large bowl, mix 2 cups flour, sugar, salt and yeast. Heat sour cream, water and 1/4 cup butter or margarine until hot.  Add to dry ingredients. Beat 2 minutes at low speed. Add egg and beat 2 minutes at medium speed.  Stir in enough remaining flour to made a soft dough.  On a floured surface, knead for 4 minutes.  Place in greased bowl, cover and let rise in warm place 20 minutes or until doubled in size. Punch dough down.   Roll dough to a 16 by 9-inch rectangle.  Spread remaining 2 tablespoons butter on dough.  In small bowl, combine fruit, nuts, brown sugar and cinnamon; sprinkle over dough.  Roll as for jelly roll; seal ends.  Place on greased baking sheet, seam sides down.  Seal ends to form a ring.  Cut slits 2/3 of way through at one inch intervals.  Turn each section on its side.  Cover and let rise in warm place 20 minutes or until almost doubled.  Bake at 375 degrees for 20-25 minutes.  Cool then drizzle with glaze. Glaze:  Mix all ingredients together until smooth.
