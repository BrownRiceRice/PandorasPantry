                        grapefruit peel
   1 1/2          cups  sugar
       1           cup  water
                        granulated sugar

Slice peel thin; scrape out as much pectin as you can.

Drop in a syrup made of sugar and water, let come to boil and continue to cook slow until peels are tender, about 25 to 30 minutes.

Drain for a few minutes and while still hot roll in sugar.

Let cool before storing.
