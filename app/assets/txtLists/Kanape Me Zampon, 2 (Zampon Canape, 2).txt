                        zampon
                        crackers
                        cooked beet slices
                        pitted black olives

Cut zampon to fit shape of the crackers you are using. With a sharp knife, cut out small hearts and diamonds from the beet rounds; cut out small clubs and spades from the olives. Decorate the zampon canapes with these so they resemble playing cards.
