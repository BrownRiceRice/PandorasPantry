--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  Semi-sweet Chocolate Chips
       1    tablespoon  Light Corn Syrup
       1    tablespoon  Water
     1/3           cup  Creamy Peanut Butter
     1/3           cup  Sugar
       3   tablespoons  Light Corn Syrup
       3   tablespoons  Water
     1/4           cup  Chopped Peanuts
       2         large  Egg Whites
       2   tablespoons  Sugar
       1      teaspoon  Vanilla
       1           cup  Heavy Cream -- whipped

Prepare the Peanut Butter Cookie Crust. Crush the cookies and melt the butter or margarine. Combine them and mix well. Press the crumb mixture into the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch pie plate. Chill in the refrigerator until set.
Combine the chocolate chips, 1 tablespoon of light corn syrup and 1 tablespoon of water in the top of a double boiler. Cook over simmering water until the chocolate melts and the mixture is smooth. Remove from the heat and cool well.
Meanwhile combine the peanut butter, 1/3 cup of sugar, 3 tablespoons of corn syrup, and 3 tablespoons of water in a 2-qt saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture is well blended. Pour into a bowl and stir in the peanuts; cool.
Beat the egg whites until foamy, using an electric mixer at high speed. Gradually add 2 tablespoons of sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in the vanilla and continue beating until stiff, glossy peaks form when the beaters are slowly lifted. Fold the egg white mixture into the whipped cream. Then fold in the peanut butter mixture. Pour half of the peanut butter mixture into the peanut butter cookie crust. Drizzle half of the chocolate mixture over the filling. Top with the remaining filling. Drizzle the remaining chocolate in parallel lines over the filling. Pull a knife across the lines at 1 inch intervals. Freeze until firm.
Wrap securely in aluminum foil. Return to the freezer and continue freezing 8 hours or overnight. Remove from the freezer 10 minutes before serving.
