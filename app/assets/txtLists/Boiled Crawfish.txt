--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       4         boxes  salt (no size mentioned)
       6       pouches  crab boil
       9                lemons
       8        ounces  cayenne pepper
       5        pounds  small white onions
       4        cloves  garlic
      24         small  potatoes
                        smoked sausage
      10          cups  corn
      50        pounds  live crawfish

Bring seasonings to boil for 10 minutes.  Add potatoes, corn, and smoked sausage.  Boil for another 10 minutes.  Add crawfish. Bring back to boil.  Cut fire off immediately.  Let soak for 20 to 30 minutes.  Drain.  Peel and eat.     While water is coming to a boil, cull and clean crawfish. Rinse well with garden hose and remove any dead ones.     Always wear gloves when you fool with crawfish, but remember, they can still pinch you through gloves. Justin Wilson writes, "Not everybody likes the fat, but I do, and I love to dig my finger into the head and scoop it out.  During crawfish season, my finger stays yellow from one end to the other."
