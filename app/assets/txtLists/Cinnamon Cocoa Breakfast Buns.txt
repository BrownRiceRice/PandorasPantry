     1/2           cup  cooked mashed potatoes
     1/4           cup  milk
     1/4           cup  water (70: to 80:F)
       1      teaspoon  salt
   3 1/4          cups  bread flour
     1/2           cup  sugar
       2     teaspoons  Fleischmann's. Bread Machine Yeast
                        FILLING
       1    tablespoon  butter or margarine -- melted
     1/4           cup  sugar

To make dough: Measure all dough ingredients into bread machine pan in the order suggested by manufacturer, adding potatoes with liquid ingredients. Process on dough/manual cycle.

To shape and fill: When cycle is complete, remove dough to floured surface. If necessary, knead in additional flour to make dough easy to handle. Roll to 15 W 9-inch rectangle; brush with 1 tablespoon melted butter. In small bowl, combine 1/4 cup sugar, cocoa and cinnamon; sprinkle evenly on dough to within 1/2 inch of edges.

Beginning at long end, roll up tightly; pinch seam to seal. With sharp knife, cut roll into 12 equal pieces. Place, cut sides up, into 12 greased (2 1/2-inch) muffin cups. Cover; let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 45 to 60 minutes. 

Bake at 375:F for 15 to 20 minutes or until done. Remove from cups; cool on wire racks. Lightly sift powdered sugar over tops.
