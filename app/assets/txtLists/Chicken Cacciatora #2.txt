       1                chicken -- cut in pieces
     1/3           cup  salad oil
       2        medium  onions -- cut in 1/4" slices
       1   large   can  tomatoes
       1           can  seasoned tomato sauce
       2        cloves  garlic -- minced
   1 1/2     teaspoons  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  celery seed
     1/2      teaspoon  oregano or sage
       1                bay leaves -- (up to 2)

Brown chick in hot salad oil, then remove. Add onions and cook over low heat until golden but not brown. Drain off excess fat. Add remaining ingredients. Add chicken and simmer covered 15 minutes; uncover and cook, turning chicken in sauce occasionally, until chicken is tender and sauce is thick (consistency of catsup), about 45 minutes to 1 hour. Skim off excess fat and remove bay leaf before serving.
