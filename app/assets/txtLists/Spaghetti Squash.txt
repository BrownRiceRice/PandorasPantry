       1                spaghetti squash -- 1 1/2
                        to 2 lbs.
       1           cup  grated cheddar cheese
       1           cup  grated mozzarella cheese
   1 1/2           cup  grated zucchini or diced
                        green pepper
       2           cup  tomato sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  oregano
     1/2      teaspoon  garlic powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt (or less)
       1          dash  pepper
     1/2           cup  grated parmesan cheese

Cut squash in half lengthwise. Scoop out seeds. Place squash, cut side down, in 2" simmering water; cover and cook 15 minutes. (Now call the kids to watch!) Holding the hot squash in a potholder, run the tines of a fork across its pulp-and like magic, there is your spaghetti! Mix the strands with the cheeses, zucchini or peppers, sauce, oregano, garlic, salt and pepper in a large bowl. Scoop back into squash shells, top with Parmesan, and bake at 350 for 20 minutes.
