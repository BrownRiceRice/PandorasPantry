--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  margarine
   1 1/2          cups  sugar
       1                egg
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
       1           cup  sour milk
       1      teaspoon  baking soda -- added to milk
       3          cups  rhubar -- cut up
       1      teaspoon  vanilla
       1      teaspoon  baking powder
   2 1/2          cups  flour
     1/2           cup  margarine
       1           cup  sugar
       1      teaspoon  vanilla
       1     small can  evaporated milk *

*Size of can is questionable, but I remember the small +/- 6-7 oz size. Mix well and pour into a greased and floured 9 x 13 pan. Bake at 350: for 45 minutes. While cake is still warm out of the oven, spread with topping which has been heated over low heat until thickened and cooled.
