  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       5        quarts  popped popcorn
       1      teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
                        GLAZE
       2          cups  sugar
   1 1/2          cups  water
     1/2           cup  light corn syrup
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
       1      teaspoon  vinegar
                        MATERIALS
      24         large  gumdrops
                        Wooden picks
                        Candies (Lifesavers and licorice drops)
       2                black licorice strings

Keep popcorn warm in a 300-degree Fahrenheit oven. In a heavy medium saucepan, combine sugar, water, corn syrup, salt and vinegar. Bring to a boil, stirring until sugar dissolves; clip candy thermometer to pan.
Cook syrup to 250 degrees (hard-ball stage); remove from heat and add vanilla. Pour syrup in thin stream over popcorn, tossing to coat kernels evenly.
Butter or dampen hands: quickly shape glazed popcorn into 7 or 8 egg-shaped forms for bunny bodies, about 6 inches long each. With a rolling pin, roll 15 to 16 gumdrops on a sugared board until flat. Cut 7 or 8 pairs of rabbit ears from gumdrops; insert wooden picks at one end and stick 1 pair into head end of each popcorn bunny.
Use Lifesavers or licorice drops for eyes, gumdrop "trimmings" for noses and mouths, and several short pieces of licorice strings for whiskers; attach to bunny faces with a little hot corn syrup. For tails, secure remaining gum drops to bunnies with wooden picks.
