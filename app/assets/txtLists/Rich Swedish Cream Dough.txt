       1      envelope  active dry yeast
     1/4           cup  warm water -- 115 degrees
       1           cup  heavy cream
     1/4           cup  evaporated milk
       3                egg yolks -- slightly beaten
   3 1/2          cups  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  sugar
       1      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  butter -- at room temperature

Stir yeast into warm water to dissolve in small bowl.  Mix well the dissolved yeast, cream, milk and egg yolks, set aside.

In large bowl stir together flour, sugar and salt.  Cut in 1/2 cup butter with pastry blender or 2 knifes until mixture resembles course crumbs.  Stir yeast mixture into flour mixture just to moisten.  Spread dough with light film of butter to prevent drying, cover bowl with plastic and refrigerate overnight or up to 4 days.
