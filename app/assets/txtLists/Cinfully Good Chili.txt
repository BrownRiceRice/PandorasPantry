     1/4      teaspoon  ground cloves
     1/4      teaspoon  mace
     1/4      teaspoon  ground coriander
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cardamom
     1/2                bay leaf
       1      teaspoon  honey
     1/2         ounce  unsweetened chocolate -- grate
                        tomato juice as needed
       1       9 ounce  thi  spaghetti;cook -- butter
      16        ounces  canned kidney beans -- heated
                        drained
       2                onions -- chopped
     3/4         pound  cheddar cheese -- grated

1.  Sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon salt in a large skillet. Heat to medium and add the meat, the first two chopped onions that appear first in the recipe,the garlic. Cook until Meat is browned but still soft. 2. Add tomato sauce, catsup, water and vinegar.  When mixture boils, add the rest of the salt,the remaining spices and herbs, the honey and chocolate. Adjust seasonings, adding more salt if it needs perking up, more cumin for a more strident chili flavor, more cinnamon and mace if you want it more aromatic, more cardamom for more band and more chocolate for more body. 3. Cover and simmer on very low heat for about 1 hour, stirring and tasting occasionally, adding tomato juice if it is getting too dry. It should be a thick sauce. Discard bay leaf. 4. For 5 way chili(use small oval plate if available), layer spaghetti on the plate, top it with chili, then with a sparse layer of kidney beans & then chopped, raw onions. Pat on the cheese while the chili is still hot and serve immediately, with oyster crackers on the side. You may, if desired, omit either the beans or onions, or both, for 3-way chili or 4-way chili.
