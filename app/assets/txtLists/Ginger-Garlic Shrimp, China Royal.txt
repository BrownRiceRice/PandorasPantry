      16                jumbo shrimp, with shell
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
       1         piece  ginger *
       3        cloves  garlic peeled/crushed
       2                green onions/scallions **

*     Ginger should be 1 inch long, peeled and minced. **    Green Onions/Scallions should be trimmed and thinly sliced 

Slit the shrimp up the back with a sharp knife and remove the vein.  Do not shell the shrimp.  Heat the oil in a wok or wide heavy skillet.  When the oil is rippling, throw in the shrimp and stir-fry over high heat for 2 minutes.  Drain very well.  Return 1/2 T oil to the wok.  Heat.  Throw in the shrimp along with the ginger, garlic, and onions.  Stir-fry for 20 seconds.  Season with salt and freshly ground pepper.  Stir-fry for an additional 20 seconds.  Serve at once.
