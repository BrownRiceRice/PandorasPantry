       2        pounds  mixed beans - great
                        northerns -- white beans
                        romans -- and random mix.
       1      teaspoon  salt (omitted)
       1      teaspoon  dry mustard
       2     teaspoons  dry mustard
     1/2      teaspoon  fresh ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  black pepper from a bottle
       1          dash  hot sauce
       1      teaspoon  (heaping) hot chili
                        condiment
     1/2           cup  chopped onion
   1 1/2          cups  coarse chopped onion
     1/4           cup  molasses or honey
     1/2           cup  (scant) honey
     1/4           cup  brown sugar
       8     teaspoons  white sugar
     1/4           cup  cider vinegar
     1/2           cup  white vinegar

Presoak beans.  Drain.  Combine dry ingredients and mix with beans; stir in other ingredients.  Pour into 1 1/2 qt. or 2 qt. baking dish or bean pot. [Obviously, if you double the recipe like I did, you'll need a bigger pot :-]  Pour in boiling water to cover.  Cover.  Bake at 300 degrees for 6 hours; add a bit of boiling water if needed.  (Crock-pot method: cook on low 8-10 hours.)  Comments:  I just dumped everything on top of the beans and stirred them; then covered them with hot tap water.  They took a lot longer than 10 hours to cook, but that might have been due to too-low heat on the crockpot. (Also, reportedly vinegar and other acid substances need to be added at the end of cooking else they'll make the beans tough.)  These beans were *really* good.  The caramelized onions were even better. I've enjoyed the beans plain, with barbecue sauce, and with spinach and corn added.
