Many recipes come out of the Caribbean that people either like or hate on first taste.  This particular recipe is for a chowder that is excellent.  Heat the oil in a large soup pot.  

Saute the onion and garlic until the onions are translucent.  Add all of the other ingredients except the shrimp, clams and  the fish. Simmer for 1 hour or until the vegetables are tender.  Add the seafood and cook for 7 to 10 minutes at a low boil.
