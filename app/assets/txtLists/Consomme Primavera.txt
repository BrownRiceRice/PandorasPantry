       1                onion
       2        sprigs  fresh parsley
       2        stalks  celery
       1      teaspoon  whole black peppercorns
       1                and
                        crushed
     1/2                carrots
                        salt
       1                turnip
       1                yellow squash
       1                parsnip
       1                zucchini
       3         pound  chicken backs and necks
       1                leek
       1                bay leaf
     1/2           cup  fresh enoki mushrooms
       1            cl  garlic
                        thinly sliced
       1         sprig  fresh thyme

Coarsely chop the onion, celery, 1 carrot, the turnip, and parsnip.  Place in a large stock pot.  Add 1-1/2 quarts water, the chicken parts, bay leaf, garlic, thyme, parsley, peppercorns, and salt to taste.  Bring very slowly to a simmer; cook 2-1/2 to 3 hours.

 Strain through a double layer of cheesecloth.  Set aside to cool.

 Peel the skins off the yellow squash and zucchini, discarding or reserving the pulp for other use.  Julienne the peels, remaining 1/2 carrot, and the leek into uniform 1/8 in. by 2 in. matchsticks.  Place in a steamer over boiling water; cook 1 minute. Remove and allow to cool.

 Skim any fat that has risen to the top of the consomme. Return the broth to a slow simmer; cook until reduced to one-fourth its original volume.

 To serve, divide among four soup bowls. Garnish with the julienned vegetables & the mushrooms.
