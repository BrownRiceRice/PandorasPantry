--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1          head  iceberg lettuce
     1/2           cup  cider vinegar
       2   tablespoons  sugar
       1    tablespoon  flour
     1/2      teaspoon  dry mustard
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
       2                Eggs
       2   tablespoons  heavy cream
                        Sliced tomatoes -- optional

Core, rinse and thoroughly drain lettuce; chill in disposable plastic bag or plastic crisper.

Heat vinegar to boiling.

In separate bowl, combine sugar, flour, mustard and salt.  Add eggs and beat just until blended.

Stir in a little hot vinegar, then add mixture to remaining vinegar.   cook over low heat, stirring constantly until thickened, about 5 minutes. Stir in cream; chill.

At serving time, cut head of lettuce lengthwise into halves; place cut-sides down on board and slice crosswise with thin-blade knife.  (1 head lettuce will yield about 4 cups shredded lettuce.)

Place in serving bowl and toss with dressing.

Serve with sliced tomatoes, is desired.
