Chickpeas should be soaked overnight in enough water to cover them by 4 inches, drained, and rinsed.  In a large saucepan simmer the chickpeas in the water, covered partially, for 1 1/2 hours, or until they are tender.  In a heavy kettle cook the onions and the garlic in the oil over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are golden, add the bell peppers, and cook the mixture, stirring, for 10 minutes.  Add the chick-peas with the cooking liquid, the kale, the tomatoes with the juice, the tomato paste, the chili powder, the thyme, the oregano, the red pepper flakes, the cumin, the sugar, and the bay leaf, bring the liquid to a boil, and simmer the stew, stirring occasionally, for 1 hour.  Discard the bay leaf, season the stew with salt, and serve the stew on the couscous or rice.  Makes about 14 cups, serving 8 to 10.
