   1 1/4          cups  butter or margarine -- softened
     1/3           cup  vegetable oil
   1 1/4          cups  brown sugar
   1 1/4          cups  white sugar
       2         large  eggs
   2 1/2     teaspoons  vanilla extract
   1 3/4          cups  all-purpose flour
     3/4           cup  whole wheat flour

Gradually blend into creamed mixture. Stir in hazelnuts. Drop by tablespoons onto ungreased baking sheet. Bake in a 350 degree oven for 8 to 9 minutes. (Do not overbake; cookies will be soft.)
