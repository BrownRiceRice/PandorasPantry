  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1           cup  sourdough starter
       1    tablespoon  shortening -- melted
       1      teaspoon  salt
       1           cup  flour

Mix ingredients, working in the flour until you have a soft dough. Roll out into a flat shape.  Dash oil over a dough sheet and place dough on it. Bake about 5 minutes. It doesn't take long, so watch carefully. Have pizza sauce and topping ready and make pizza as usual. Then bake as usual.
