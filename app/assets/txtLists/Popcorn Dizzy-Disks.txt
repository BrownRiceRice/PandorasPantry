       2        quarts  warm unsalted -- popped popcorn
                        QUICKIE GLAZE
     2/3           cup  light corn syrup
     2/3           cup  sugar
       1      teaspoon  salt
                        Food coloring

Keep popcorn hot and crisp in a 300-degree Fahrenheit oven. In a heavy, medium saucepan, combine syrup, sugar and salt.
Bring to a boil over medium heat; boil 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Add food coloring until desired color is obtained.
Pour syrup slowly over popcorn and toss lightly to coat kernels evenly. Pack popcorn into three buttered, miniature layer cake pans. Decorate each disk to resemble a pumpkin, an owl, a witch or other seasonal symbol.
Decorations:Candies (Lifesavers, nibs, black licorice strings, candy corn, jelly beans, gum drops)
Chewing gum, chiclet-style miniatures, materials (colored construction paper, round-headed straight pins, ribbon, yarn, sequins)
