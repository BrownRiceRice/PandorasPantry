     1/2           cup  walnut pieces
     1/2           cup  Maytag, Oregon
                        Danish or Bleu cheese

       1      teaspoon  cognac
       1      teaspoon  minced walnuts -- for garnish

Process the walnuts in a food processor until they are finely chopped, using short pulses to avoid overprocessing. Add the Bleu cheese and cream cheese, and process until they are thoroughly combined. Add the cognac, process until well mixed, and then transfer the mixture to one large or two small ramekins. Sprinkle with the minced walnuts, and serve. Yield: 3/4 cup (8 to 10 appetizer servings) This recipe is from the: Farmhouse Cookbook
