       1           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  light corn syrup
     1/3           cup  water
     1/4           cup  butter or margarine
       1      teaspoon  salt
       2        quarts  warm popped popcorn
                        Pipe cleaners
       1     Small rib  bon bows
                        Green colored shredded coconut

Combine first five ingredients. Cook slowly to the crack stage (280-290 degrees Fahrenheit). Place popcorn in large buttered mixing bowl.
Drizzle syrup over corn; stir just until corn is uniformly coated with syrup. Press a thin layer of popcorn mixture evenly over outside bottom and sides of buttered custard cups or small cereal bowls. Allow to cool.
Remove from cups or bowls. Use pipe cleaners to make handles, attach a tiny ribbon bow to handles; fill baskets with green colored coconut or green cellophane and top with jelly beans.
