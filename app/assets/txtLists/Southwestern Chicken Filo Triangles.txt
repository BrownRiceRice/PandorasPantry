     1/2           cup  monterey jack cheese -- grated

      16        ounces  phyllo dough -- thawed
                        -- in refrigerator
       1           cup  butter -- or as needed, melted
                        -------relish-----
       2   tablespoons  olive oil
       4           ear  corn -- kernels scraped off
       6                roma tomatoes -- finely chopped
       1         large  onion -- finely chopped
       1    tablespoon  fresh cilantro -- minced
                        salt -- to taste
                        black pepper -- to taste

Cut dough crosswise into 5 equal sections. If you want to serve it as an entree, then cut the filo dough into 4 sections so that the triangles will be larger. Make 4 or 5 of them per serving.     

In a medium bowl place the chicken, cheese, red bell peppers, Roma tomatoes, green chile peppers, and cilantro. Mix the ingredients together well.     

Preheat the oven to 400:.      

For each section of the filo dough (cover the other sections with a slightly damp cloth and keep them in the refrigerator), separate the pieces and lay them out flat on a large surface (work quickly). Brush all the pieces with the melted butter. Turn them over and brush the other side.      

Place a teaspoon of the chicken mixture at one end of each piece of dough. Fold the bottom left corner over the filling so that the bottom edge lines up with the side edge. Continue to fold the dough up in this manner (as you would fold a flag,) so that a multi-folded triangle is formed. Keep the completed triangles under a damp cloth.      

On an oiled baking sheet, place the filo triangles and bake them for 20 minutes, or until they are a golden brown.      

Serve the triangles with the Corn Relish and Guacamole on the side. 

RELISH: In a medium large saute pan place the olive oil and heat in on medium until it is hot. Add the remainder of the ingredients and saute them for 10 minutes, or until the corn is done. Makes approximately 4 cups.
