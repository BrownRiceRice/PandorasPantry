--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1 1/2           cup  unbleached flour -- sifted
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  brown sugar -- packed
       2      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
       1         large  egg -- slightly beaten
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil
     1/2           cup  milk
     1/2           cup  chopped pecans

Sift together flour, sugar, brown sugar, baking powder, salt and cinnamon into mixing bowl.

 Combine egg, oil and mil in small bowl; blend well.  Add all at once to dry ingredients, stirring just enough to moisten.  Stir in pecans.  Spoon batter into greased 2 1/2-inch muffin-pan cups, filling each 2/3rds full.

 Bake in 400 degree F. oven 20 minutes or until golden brown.  Serve hot with butter and homemade jelly or jam.

 Serving Hint:

 Match the mood of your mealtime by using a variety of pretty napkins to line a muffin basket.  For a picnic, choose a red and white checked napkin; for special dinners, use your finest linen napkins; and for Christmas, of course, a bright red napkin.
