--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1         pound  confectioners sugar
     1/2           cup  cocoa
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  milk
       1      teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/2           cup  butter -- or margarine
       1           cup  nuts -- chopped

In 1 1/2 quart casserole stir sugar, cocoa, salt, milk and vanilla together until partially blended (mixture is too stiff to thoroughly blend in all of dry ingredients). Put butter over top in center of dish. Microwave at High (10) 2 minutes. Stir vigorously until smooth. If all butter has not melted in cooking, it will as mixture is stirred. Blend in nuts. Pour into wax paper lined 8 x 8 x 2-inch dish. Chill 1 hour in refrigerator or 20 to 30 minutes in freezer. Cut into squares. Makes about 36 squares. PEANUT BUTTER FUDGE: Follow directions above except substitute 1/2 cup crunchy peanut butter for cocoa. Add peanut butter after microwaving (I like chopped peanuts for this one.) COFFEE FONDANT: Prepare 2-Minute Fudge as above, except omit cocoa and substitute 1 tablespoon instant coffee granules dissolved in 2 tablespoons milk. Before fondant sets, press "chocolate shot" decors into top.
