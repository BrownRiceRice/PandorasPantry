--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1       package  Active Dry Yeast
                        OR
       1    tablespoon  Bulk Active Dry Yeast
     1/4           cup  Water -- warm: 110-115 Deg F
   2 1/4          cups  Unbleached Flour -- unsifted
       1    tablespoon  Butter -- at roomtemperature
       1           cup  Sharp Cheddar -- grated
   1 1/4     teaspoons  Salt
       1         large  Egg
       1           cup  Cottage Cheese (the small curd kind) -- at room temperature
       1    tablespoon  Sugar

Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water and let stand 5 minutes. Gently stir to completely dissolve. 
With an electric mixer, blend the softened yeast into the cottage cheese, sugar, salt and egg. Add the flour in 1/2 cup portions to form a stiff but light dough and let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk. Butter a 1 1/2 quart casserole dish and stir the dough down, then add 1 cup of the grated cheddar cheese. Turn into the buttered dish. Let rise 30 to 40 minutes longer or until almost doubled in size.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and bake for 40 to 50 minutes or until golden brown. Brush the top with butter.
