                        -----chips-----
       2                (about 1 lb) idaho -- baking potatoes (2
                        to 3)
       1         quart  to 2 quarts peanut or -- canola oil, for
                        frying
                        -----chip seasoning-----
     1/2      teaspoon  pure red chile powder
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne chile powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt

Note: Idaho russet baking potatoes make the best chips, as they are high in moisture and low in sugar.

 1. Peel and slice the potatoes paper-thin with a mandolin or in a food processor. Soak the sliced potatoes in ice-cold water 5 minutes. (You can slice the potatoes ahead of time and hold them in water as long as 4 or 5 hours.) Drain in a salad spinner or lay flat on kitchen towels and pat dry.

 2. Heat the oil in a deep fryer or large pot to 350 degrees. Meanwhile, thoroughly combine all the chip seasoning ingredients in a bowl. Fry the potatoes in batches until crisp and brown. Remove with a slotted spoon or use a spoon and strainer, and drain on paper towels.

 3. Transfer to a large bowl and toss chips with chip seasoning while still warm.

 Serving suggestions: For best results, serve immediately. Good with burgers, sandwiches, or with eggs and chorizo for breakfast or brunch. Storage: Can be stored in a cool, dry place two to three days, or up to one week in dry climates.
