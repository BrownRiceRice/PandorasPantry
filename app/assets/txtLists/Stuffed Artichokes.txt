--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       3            lg  artichokes
       5         ounce  parmesan cheese -- grated
       1    lg   clove  garlic -- minced
       1           cup  italian bread crumbs
     1/4           cup  olive oil (this needs to
                        be olive oil -- no
                        substitute)
                        lemon juice

Cut the stems and the tops (Just low enough to remove the pointy ends of the leaves) off of the artichokes. Mix cheese, garlic,and crumbs. Spread the artichoke leaves so you can fill each layer, from the outside in, with the crumb mixture.

 Place the artichokes in a pot with about 1-2 inches of water.  Drizzle olive oil and lemon juice over the top of each artichoke. Cover and steam 45 minutes or longer, checking occasionally that the water has not completely evaporated. The artichokes are done when a leaf can be easily pulled off.
