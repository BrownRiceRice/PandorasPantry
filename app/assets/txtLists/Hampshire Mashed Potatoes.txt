   1 1/2        pounds  Russet potatoes
       3          cups  water
       1      teaspoon  salt
     3/4           cup  Knudsen Hampshire Sour Cream
       2   tablespoons  butter
                        Salt to taste

 Peel and quarter potatoes.

 Cook potatoes in boiling salted water until they break apart when pierced with a fork.

 Drain the liquid from the potatoes (reserve it for gravy if you wish) and return the potatoes to low heat to dry any moisture remaining.

 Scoop the sour cream into the bottom of the pan with the potatoes and allow to heat.  Add butter.

 Whip potatoes with electric mixer until light, smooth and fluffy.  Add additional salt is necessary.

VARIATION:  Buttermilk Mashed Potatoes - Substitute 1/2 cup buttermilk for sour cream.

Serves: 4 - 6.
