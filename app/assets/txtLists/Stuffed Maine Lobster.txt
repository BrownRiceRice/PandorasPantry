       6                lobsters-maine (1 1/4 lb.)
       1           cup  celery-diced
       1           cup  onion-diced
       1           cup  scallops-cubed
       1           cup  bay shrimp-diced
     1/2           cup  crab meat
       4   tablespoons  butter
                        salt & ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  msg
     1/4           cup  sherry
   1 1/4          cups  mayonnaise
       6     teaspoons  cracker meal

Preheat oven to 350. Immerse lobsters in boil- ing salted water for 5-7 mins. & let cool in the same water. While they're cooling, saute celery, onion, scallops, shrimp & crab meat in butter. Season to taste w/ salt & pepper. Add MSG & sherry. Strain mixture to release excess liquid. While this mixture is draining, if lob- sters have cooled sufficiently, place them belly side up on a cutting board. Cut them down the middle w/ a sharp knife & open them flat, leaving the meat intact. Remove the stuffing mixture from the strainer to a bowl. Add the mayonnaise & stir gently until well mixed. Mound filling on each lobster shell. Sprinkle cracker meal over the tops. Bake 5-7 minutes in preheated oven until golden brown.
