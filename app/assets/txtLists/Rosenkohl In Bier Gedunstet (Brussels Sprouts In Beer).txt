       1         pound  brussels sprouts -- fresh
                        beer; any brand -- to cover
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
       2            tb  butter

Trim and wash sprouts.  Place in a medium-size saucepan and pour enough beer over them to cover.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes or until tender.  Add more beer if needed, as liquid evaporates. Drain; add salt and butter.  Serve hot.
