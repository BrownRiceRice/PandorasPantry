--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1         pound  small fresh white mushrooms
       3   tablespoons  olive oil -- divided
     1/3           cup  chopped onion
       2     teaspoons  finely chopped garlic
     1/3           cup  pine nuts -- toasted
     1/2      teaspoon  oregano leaves -- crushed
     1/8      teaspoon  ground black pepper
       4        ounces  crumbled Feta (plain or flavored) or goat
                        cheese -- about 3/4 cup

Heat oven to 400:F. Remove mushroom stems. Chop stems (makes about 1 cup);
reserve. In a medium bowl, place caps; toss with 1 tablespoon of the oil.
On a shallow baking pan, arrange mushroom caps, cavity side down; bake
until tender, about 10 minutes. In a small skillet, over medium heat, heat
remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Add onion, garlic and reserved mushroom
stems; cook and stir until stems are tender and liquid evaporates, about 5
minutes. Stir in pine nuts, oregano and pepper. Transfer to a bowl; stir
in Feta until mixture is well blended. Turn mushrooms over; stuff with
cheese mixture. Bake until heated through, about 15 minutes; serve hot.
