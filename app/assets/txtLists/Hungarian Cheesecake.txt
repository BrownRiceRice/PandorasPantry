(3 to 4 TBLS) ~------------------------------------------------------ ~----------------- Sift together the flour and baking powder, set aside. Cream the butter in a large mixing bowl, then add the egg yolks, salt, and lemon juice, mixing well. Add the dry mixture, then using your fingers, work the dough into a smooth consistency. Add the cold water as necessary to work the dough. Roll the dough out on a flat surface to a thickness of 1/4-inch. Cut the dough to fit the greased bottom of a 9-inch springform pan and place the dough in the bottom. Use the excess to line the sides of the pan. Chill. CHEESECAKE: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Press the cottage cheese through a sieve.  In a large mixing bowl, beat 3 eggs and the sugar until well blended.  Add the cottage cheese and beat, then stir in the lemon rind and the sour cream. Separate the remaining egg, saving the yolk for another recipe, and brush the crust with the white. Com bine the pineapple and raisins in a bowl, then spread the mixture evenly on the prepared crust. Pour the cheese mixture on the top of the fruit mixture. Bake for 10 minutes at 450 degrees F. then reduce the oven to 350 degrees F. and bake for about another 35 minutes. Cool to room temperature, then chill. Serve chilled.
