       2        medium  eggplants -- peeled
      18        ounces  Ricotta cheese
       2   tablespoons  olive oil
       2          cups  tomato sauce
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
     1/2      teaspoon  salt

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.

Peel eggplant and slice into 12 pieces, 1/4-inch thick. Slice from top to bottom. Lay slices on a paper towel and sprinkle salt on them to allow water to drain from the slices.

In skillet, cook eggplant slices with olive oil. Lay on paper towel to let the oil drain. Roll 1-1/2 ounce of Ricotta cheese in each slice. Pour tomato sauce in casserole and neatly place manicotti in rows on top of the sauce.

Bake in oven at 400 degrees F until hot all the way through. Remove manicotti from pan onto serving dish. 

SAUCE: Put pan of tomato sauce on stove and add heavy cream until the sauce is pink. Simmer 2 or 3 minutes. Pour sauce over manicotti and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
