       1         pound  pork -- cut in thin strips /
       3           cup  celery -- thin sliced
       1           cup  onion -- sliced
       1   6 ounce can  mushrooms -- drained
       3    tablespoon  cornstarch
     1/4           cup  water
      10         ounce  chicken broth
     1/4           cup  soy sauce -- light
       5           cup  water chestnuts -- drained

In hot deep skillet or wok, brown meat in 1 tsp. oil. Remove from pan. Add 1 tsp. oil to pan and cook celery and onion until crisp tender. Add mushrooms.  Blend cornstarch  into  water and when smooth add chicken broth  and  soy sauce.  Put meat back into pan with veggies and add bean sprouts  and  water chestnuts. Pour sauce over all and heat through.  Serve over chow mein noodles with steamed rice on the side.  Note: to cut down on sodium I rinse all canned vegetables well. If you like you  can add chopped green peppers, fresh mushrooms and thin sliced  cabbage when  stir frying the vegetables.   You can also use chicken or beef if you prefer  not to use pork.  I like pork because that's the way my  mom  always made this recipe.FROM: JEANETTE MURCH   (PNNN10B)
