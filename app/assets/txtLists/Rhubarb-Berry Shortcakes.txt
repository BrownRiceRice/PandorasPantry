Combine in a saucepan the approx. 2 cups of rhubarb slices, sugar, water, cinnamon and allspice. Bring to a boil, stirring, and reduce heat and simmer for 5-7 minutes. Blend cornstarch with water and add to sauce and cook, stirring, until sauce boils and thickens. Add the strawberries and bring to a simmer. Bake the refrigerated biscuits, (or from scratch)_.
