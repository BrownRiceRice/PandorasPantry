Melt butter in boiling water. Add flour; stir vigorously. Cook and stir until mixture forms a ball that doesn't separate. Remove from heat and cool slightly. Preheat oven to 400. Add egg; beat vigorously until smooth. Stir in cheese.  Drop dough onto greased baking sheet, using 1 level teaspoon dough for each puff. Bake for 20 minutes. Remove from oven; cool and split. Finely chop cooked chicken, pimiento, and olives. Combine with remaining ingredients. Fill each puff with 2 teaspoons.
