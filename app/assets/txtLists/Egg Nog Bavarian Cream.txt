 Soften the gelatin in the wine in a 2 cup glass measure

 Place the cup containing the gelatin in a pan of water.  Heat until the gelatin completely dissolves.

 Add the sugar and salt to the gelatin.  Then add 1 cup of the egg nog slowly to the gelatin mixture, stirring and heating until the mixture is blended.

 Blend the gelatin mixture with the remaining 2 cups of egg nog and chill until thickened but not set.

 Whip the cream until stiff and fold into the partially set egg nog mixture.

 Pour the completed cream into a 1 1/2 quart mold or into individual molds or sherbert glasses.

 At serving time, unmold if molded, and garnish with walnut halves and dribble walnut sundae over all.
