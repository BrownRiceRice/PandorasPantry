--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       2          cups  flour -- all purpose
       1           cup  sugar
   1 1/2     teaspoons  baking powder,double-acting
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
       1      teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  shortening,vegetable
     3/4           cup  orange juice,fresh
       1    tablespoon  orange peel,grated
       1                egg -- well-beaten
     1/2           cup  nuts -- chopped
   1 1/2          cups  cranberries -- coarse chop

Sift together flour, sugar, baking powder, soda and salt. Cut in shortening until mixture resembles coarse cornmeal. (Do in food processor?)  Combine orange juice and peel with beaten egg. Pour all at once into dry ingredients, mixing just until dampened. Carefully fold in nuts and cranberries.  (If frozen cranberries are used, put through food chopper in frozen state) Spoon into greased loaf pan (9x5x3) .  Spread corners and sides slightly higher than center. Bake in 350 degree oven for about 1 hour, until crust is golden brown and toothpick inserted comes out clean. Remove from pan and cool. Store overnight for easier slicing.

This is the original Ocean Spray recipe and is delicious. I sometimes add a coupe of tablespoons of chopped dried apricots to this.
