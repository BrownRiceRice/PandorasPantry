 Ask the meat cutter to cut the slabs in half lengthwise.

 Lay in shallow pan.  Brush ribs lightly with soy sauce.

 Roast 1 1/2 hours in 350 degree oven or until done.  Drain off drippings.

 Cut into serving portions two ribs wide.  Place on heated deep platter.

 Meanwhile to make sauce, combine sugar and cornstarch in saucepan.  Stir in vinegar, pineapple juice, soy sauce and green pepper.  Heat, stirring constantly, to boiling.  Boil until clear and slightly thickened.

 Just before serving, stir in pineapple chunks and pour over spareribs or serve separately.
