--------  ------------  --------------------------------
      10        medium  tomatoes
       1    tablespoon  dried crushed basil
                        OR
       1    tablespoon  tarragon
                        Salt and pepper -- to taste
      10         large  California Fresh Eggs
       6   tablespoons  butter -- melted
       1           cup  shredded Swiss cheese
       1           cup  fine, dry seasoned bread crumbs
                        Parsley or edible flowers for garnish

Preheat oven to 350. Cut thin slice from top of each tomato. Using a grapefruit knife make a circular cut (do not pierce skin) and scoop out pulp gently with a spoon. Invert tomatoes on paper towels and allow to drain. Grease 10-4" individual souffle dishes. Sprinkle the inside of each tomato with basil, salt and pepper and place upright in souffle dishes. Gently break an egg into each shell and bake 35-40 minutes or until egg whites have set. Remove from oven.

Blend melted butter, cheese and bread crumbs together. Sprinkle the tops of each egg liberally with this mixture. Return to oven and bake until crumbs are browned, about 3-5 minutes.
