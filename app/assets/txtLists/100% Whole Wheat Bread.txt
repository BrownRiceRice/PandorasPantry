--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     2/3           cup  Water
       3      packages  Yeast
       1    tablespoon  Sugar
       8          cups  Scalded Milk
     2/3           cup  Shortening
       1           cup  Sugar
     1/2           cup  Molasses
       2   tablespoons  Salt
      12          cups  Whole Wheat Flour

Dissolve yeast in 2/3 cup water while your milk is cooling. Dissolve 1 cup sugar in the hot milk. Stir all ingredients in large bowl, turn out and knead about 5 minutes, adding flour if needed. Knead about 5 minutes.
Let rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Knead down and shape into 6 loaves, let rise until doubled in pans. Bake at 375 degrees F for 40 minutes. Turn out on wire rack and let cool to cold before slicing, if you can.
