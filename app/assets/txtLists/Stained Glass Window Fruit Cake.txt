Gradually beat in dry ingredients, pour over fruit mixture and mix well.  firmly pack into pan.  Bake in 275 degree oven about 2 hours 15 minutes or until top appears dry.  Cool in pan.
May be baked in 2 9x5x3-inch loaf pans.  Top with Holiday corsage and green velvet ribbon. Or Put fruits and nuts on top.

NOTE:  I line my pans with brown paper, you can use wax paper.  Also I put a pan of water on the rack under cake while it is baking for moisture.
