      30                Raw large shrimp
     1/3           cup  olive oil
                        Salt
                        Pepper
       1          drop  hot pepper sauce
       1          drop  soy sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  thyme -- dill or tarragon
      30                Wooden skewers -- pointed (7-8 inches
                        -- long)
      15        Strips  bacon
       2        quarts  water

 Fold shrimp gently in a mixing bowl with olive oil, a sprinkle of salt and pepper, with drops of hot pepper sauce and soy sauce and, if you wish one of the spices (thyme, dill or tarragon).  Let steep 20 minutes.

 Meanwhile, soak pointed wooden skewers in cold water (to keep then from burning).  Cut bacon in half crosswise; drop then in water and blanch (boil slowly) for 5 minutes, then drain, rinse and dry them.

 Skewing.  Push the sharp end of a skewer through one end of a piece of bacon, then the large end of a shrimp, the middle part of a bacon strip, the tail of the shrimp and bacon end.  Keep in plastic on ice until cooking.

 Barbecuing or broiling.  Barbecue bacon-side down first, then bacon-side up a minute or so on each side.  Or Broil bacon-side up first, then bacon-side down - a minute or so on each side close under the hot broiler element.  Serve at once.
