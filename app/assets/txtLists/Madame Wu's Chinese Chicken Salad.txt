       2         whole  chicken breasts
       1      teaspoon  sesame oil
                        oil for deep frying in wok
       1      teaspoon  five spice powder*
      12       squares  won ton skins -- slice
     1/2           cup  sliced green onion (1 bunch)
       2         ounce  rice noodles
     1/4           cup  chopped toasted almonds
     1/4           cup  soy sauce
       1          head  lettuce -- shredded
       1    tablespoon  prepared mustard

Steam chicken breasts or cook in micro until barely done; skin, bone and shred (this is easy if you used 2 forks). In medium sized bowl, mix soy sauce, mustard, oil and Five Spice Powder (available in Asian food sections of most super markets - at least in California) and green onions; marinade chicken in this sauce, covered. Heat oil VERY hot (drop a piece of won ton skin in - if it floats right back up, oil is hot enough). Fry won ton skins until just beginning to turn golden; remove with slotted spoon to drain on paper towels (they will continue to brown when removed from heat). Fry noodles, a very few at a time, in hot oil - they will puff up almost immediately. Remove and drain immediately (they will be white). When ready to eat, slice lettuce (reserve some whole leaves to garnish bowl) thinly, add chicken and marinade, fried won ton skins and fried noodles (crumble a little as you add them), and almonds. Serve from large bowl ringed with whole lettuce leaves. Converted by MMCONV vers. 1.00
