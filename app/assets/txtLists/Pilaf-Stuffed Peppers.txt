--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1 2/3          cups  reduced-sodium vegetable broth
     3/4           cup  long-grain white rice
     1/4           cup  wild rice
       4                sweet red yellow or green peppers
       1    tablespoon  olive oil
     1/2           cup  chopped onions
       1         clove  garlic -- minced
     1/2           cup  peas -- fresh or frozen
     1/2           cup  corn -- fresh or frozen
     1/2           cup  shredded carrots
     1/2           cup  shredded reduced-fat mozzarella cheese
   1 1/2     teaspoons  chopped fresh basil
       4   thin slices  reduced-fat mozzarella cheese
       2          cups  tomato sauce -- warmed

In a small saucepan, combine the broth, white rice and wild rice. Bring to
a boil over medium heat. Cover, reduce the heat to low and simmer for 20
minutes, or until the rice is tender and the broth has been absorbed. Set
aside.

Cut the tops off the peppers, about 1" down. Remove the seeds and ribs,
being careful not to tear or rip the peppers. If necessary, trim the
pepper bottoms so that they stand upright. Blanch the peppers in gently
boiling water for 6 minutes, or until the peppers are soft but still
retain their shape. Drain well and set aside.

In a large no-stick skillet over medium heat, warm the oil. Add the onions
and sauti for 4 minutes, or until tender. Add the garlic, peas, corn and
carrots. Reduce the heat to low, cover and cook for 5 minutes. Remove from
the heat. Stir in the rice, shredded mozzarella and basil.

Preheat the oven to 375:.

Stuff the peppers with the rice mixture; top each with a slice of
mozzarella. Place the peppers upright in an 8" W 8" no-stick baking dish.
Pour 1/4" water into the dish. Bake for 15 minutes, or until heated
through. Turn on the broiler and broil about 6" from the heat for 3
minutes, or until the cheese is lightly browned and bubbly. Serve with the
tomato sauce.
