*Melted then cooled. For Crust: Stir together crushed wafers and butter. Press mixture, evenly over the bottom and 1-3/4 inches up sides of a 9-inch springform pan. Place the pan in a shallow baking pan. For Filling: In a large bowl, beat cream cheese, sugar, the 4 squares of melted chocolate, flour and vanilla until well mixed. Add eggs all at once, the beat with an electric mixer on low speed just until mixed. DO NOT OVERBEAT!  Stir in milk. Pour filling into the crust. Bake in a 350 F Oven about 45 minutes or until center appears nearly set when gently shaken. Cool on a wire rack 5 to 10 minutes. Remove sides of pan. Cover and chill for 4-24 hours. For a star design, pipe melted vanilla-flavored pieces into stars atop cheesecake. In a small saucepan melt the 1 square of chocolate and shortening over low heat, pipe into stars. Chill until chocolate is set. Serves 12 Nutrition information per serving: 524 calories, 34 grams fat, 147 mg cholesterol, 369 mg sodium.
