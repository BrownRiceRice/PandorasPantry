--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       5        pounds  corned beef brisket -- or bottom round
       1        medium  onion -- chopped
     1/4      teaspoon  garlic powder
     1/4      teaspoon  liquid hot pepper seasoning
       1      teaspoon  dill weed
       3                bay leaves -- dry
       2        sticks  cinnamon -- 3 inches long
       5                cloves
       1                orange -- unpeeled,
                        -- thinly sliced

Place corned beef in a 6 to 8 quart pan; add 2 quarts water.  Cover and bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes.  Taste water; if it's too salty, drain beef, discard water, and add 2 quarts more water to pan.

Add onion, garlic powder, hot pepper seasoning, dill weed, bay leaves, cinnamon sticks, cloves and orange slices to pan.  Cover and simmer until meat is tender when pierced (2 1/2 to 3 hours).  Remove from heat and let meat cool slightly in broth, then cover and refrigerate until next day.

To serve, remove meat from broth.  Cut across the grain into thin slices.

Preparation and cooking time:  about 3 1/2 hours.
