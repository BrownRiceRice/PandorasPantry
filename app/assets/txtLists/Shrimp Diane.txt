   1 3/4        pounds  shrimp (medium) w/heads and -- shells
       6   tablespoons  basic shrimp stock
     3/8         pound  (1-1/2 sticks) unsalted butt -- er
     1/4           cup  very finely chopped green on -- ions
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  ground red pepper (cayenne)
     1/4      teaspoon  white pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  dried sweet basil leaves
     1/4      teaspoon  dried thyme leaves
     1/8      teaspoon  dried oregano leaves
     1/2         pound  mushrooms cut into 1/4 inch -- thick slices
       3   tablespoons  very finely chopped fresh pa -- rsley

Rinse and peel the shrimp; refrigerate until needed. Use shells and heads to make the shrimp stock.  In a large skillet melt 1 stick butter over high heat. When almost melted, add the green onions, salt, garlic, ground peppers, basil, thyme and oregano; stir well. Add the shrimp and saute just until they turn pink, about 1 minute, shaking the pan (versus stirring) in a back and forth motion. Add the mushrooms and 1/4 cup stock; add the remaining 4 Tbsp butter in chunks and continue cooking, continuing to shake the pan.  Before the butter chunks are completely melted, add the parsley then the remaining 2 Tbsp stock; continue cooking and shaking the pan until all ingredients are mixed thoroughly and butter sauce is the consistency of cream. Serve immediately in a bowl with lots of French bread on this side, or serve over pasta or rice.
