                        -------seasoning mix--------
       1      teaspoon  black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  white pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme leaves
     1/4      teaspoon  rubbed sage
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cayenne pepper
     1/8      teaspoon  ground cumin
                        ------main ingredients------
       2   tablespoons  chicken, pork, or beef fat
       2   tablespoons  unsalted butter
     3/4           cup  finely chopped onions
     1/2           cup  finely chopped celery
     1/2      teaspoon  minced garlic
       6          cups  basic chicken stock
       1           cup  pan drippings from chicken
       8                gingersnap cookies
       1      teaspoon  light brown sugar, to taste
       1      teaspoon  ground ginger, to taste

Combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl and set aside. Melt the fat and butter in a large skillet over medium heat. When almost melted, add the onions, celery, and garlic; saute 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in the seasoning mix and cook 5 minutes more, stirring occasionally. Add the stock and pan drippings; bring to a boil over high heat and boil rapidly until liquid reduces to about 1 quart, about 25 minutes. Then crumble the gingersnaps into the stock mixture and whisk with a metal whisk until they are dissolved. Continue cooking 10 minutes, whisking frequently and making sure the gingersnaps are thoroughly dissolved. During this time, taste the gravy; if the ginger flavour is not pronounced,m add the 1 tablespoon brown sugar and the 1 teaspoon ginger or add both to taste. Strain the gravy. Makes 2-1/2 to 3 cups.
