  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1         pound  lean ground beef
       2     teaspoons  fresh jalapeno pepper -- seeded and chopped
   1 1/2     teaspoons  chili powder
     1/4           cup  shredded Monterey Jack cheese
       4          thin  tomato slices
       4                hamburger buns -- split, toasted

In medium bowl, combine ground beef, jalapeno pepper and chili powder, mixing lightly but thoroughly.

Shape beef mixture into four 1/2-inch thick patties.

Place patties on grid over medium ash-covered coals. Grill uncovered 14-16 minutes or until centers are no longer pink, turning once. Check with a meat thermometer for an internal temperature of 160F.

Approximately 1 minute before burgers are done, sprinkle each with 1 tablespoon cheese.

Place one slice tomato on bottom half of each bun and top with burger. Close sandwiches and serve.
