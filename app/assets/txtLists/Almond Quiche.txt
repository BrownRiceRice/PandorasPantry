     1/2           cup  onion -- chopped
       2   tablespoons  butter
       2                egg -- beaten
       1           cup  half and half
       1           cup  milk
       1    tablespoon  flour
     1/4      teaspoon  pepper -- white
   1 1/2          cups  swiss cheese -- shredded
       1           cup  almonds -- sliced
       1                pie shell -- baked

    Saute onion in butter until tender. In small bowl, beat together the eggs, both milks, flour and pepper until lightly frothy.   Stir in the cooked onion, cheese and toasted sliced almonds until well mixed. Pour the mixture into a still hot baked pie shell.   Bake at 325F for about 45 minutes. When done, a knife inserted in the middle will come out clean. Let stand for 10 minutes, slice and serve.
