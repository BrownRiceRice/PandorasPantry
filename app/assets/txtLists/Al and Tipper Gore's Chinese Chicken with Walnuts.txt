       6                chicken breast halves (boneless, skinless)
   2 1/2   tablespoons  reduced-sodium soy sauce
   1 1/2   tablespoons  water
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
       3     teaspoons  peanut oil
       2        medium  green peppers -- cut into 3/4-inch pi
       2     teaspoons  cornstarch
       2   tablespoons  dry sherry
       1      teaspoon  sugar
       1      teaspoon  grated fresh ginger
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper
       4                green onions -- diagonally sliced in
     1/3           cup  walnut halves

Cut the chicken into 1-inch pieces and set aside. Mix the soy sauce and water, then blend into the cornstarch; stir in the sherry, sugar, ginger, red pepper, and salt. 

Preheat a wok or large skillet over high heat; add 2 teaspoons of peanut oil. Stir-fry the green peppers and onions for 2 minutes and remove. Add the walnuts and stir-fry for 1 to 2 minutes until golden brown. Remove. 

Add the rest of the oil and stir-fry half of the chicken for 2 minutes. Return all the chicken to the wok and stir in the soy mixture.

Cook and stir until bubbly. Stir in the vegetables and walnuts, cover and cook for 1 minute.
