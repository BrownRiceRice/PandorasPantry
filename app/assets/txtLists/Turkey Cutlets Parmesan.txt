       2          cups  small egg bow-tie pasta
       1           cup  frozen green peas
       1    tablespoon  unsalted butter
     3/4           cup  Parmesan cheese
       4                turkey breast cutlets -- thick
       2         large  egg whites -- lightly beaten
     3/4           cup  Italian bread crumbs
       2   tablespoons  olive oil
       2         large  plum tomato, whole -- cut in 12 slices
       8         large  basil leaves
       1           cup  shredded mozzarella cheese
                        fresh ground pepper

1.  In covered 3-quart pot, bring 2 quarts hot salted water to a boil.  Add pasta; cook 6 minutes.  Add frozen peas; cook 2 minutes, until pasta is al dente and peas are crisp-tender.  Reserve 1/2 cup pasta cooking water; drain pasta.  Return pasta, peas and reserved water to pot; add butter and 1/2 cup Parmesan; stir.  cover; keep warm.

Turn cutlets over; sprinkle each with 1 tablespoon Parmesan.  Place 3 tomato slices and 2 basil leaves, overlapping, on each cutlet.  Sprinkle with mozzarella; season with pepper to taste.  Cook 1 minute.  cover skillet with lid; cook 30 seconds until cheese is melted.  Serve with pasta.
