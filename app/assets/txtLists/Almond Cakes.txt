--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1           cup  blanched almonds
   1 1/3          cups  sugar
       1           cup  all-purpose flour
       1      teaspoon  rose water -- (optional)
       3                egg whites
                        Vegetable cooking spray

Place almonds in food processor, and process until finely ground. Add sugar and flour; process until blended. Add rose water and egg whites; process until well-blended (the mixture will be very thick). With floured hands, shape the dough into 28 balls, and place 2 inches apart on baking sheets coated with cooking spray. 

Bake at 325 degrees for 28 minutes or until crisp on the outside and soft on the inside; cool on racks.
