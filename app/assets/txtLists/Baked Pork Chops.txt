  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       6                Pork chops
       1      teaspoon  Caraway seeds -- crushed
     1/2      teaspoon  Salt
       1           cup  Dry White wine
       1                Garlic clove -- minced
       2     teaspoons  Hungarian mild paprika -- (available at most
                        larger stores and at specialty shops)
                        Pepper -- as desired
       1           cup  Sour cream -- (optional)

Place the pork chops in an ovenproof casserole. Mix the remaining ingredients, except sour cream, and pour over the chops. Marinate the chops 2 to 3 hours in the refrigerator. 
Bake the chops, uncovered, in the marinade in a preheated 325 degree F oven for 1 hour or until tender. Add more wine if necessary. Stir sour cream into pan juices and heat through but DO NOT boil. Serve chops with sour-cream gravy and buttered noodles or dumplings.
