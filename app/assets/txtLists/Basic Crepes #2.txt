       2                Eggs -- slightly beaten
     2/3           Cup  Milk
       3   Tablespoons  Oil
     1/2           Cup  All-Purpose Flour
     1/4      Teaspoon  Salt

In medium bowl, stir together beaten eggs, milk and 1 Tbsp. oil.

Gradually stir in flour and salt; beat until smooth.

Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour.

Lightly brush a six or seven inch crepe pan or skillet with some of the remaining oil; heat until hot.  Stir batter.

Pour about 2 Tbsp. batter into hot pan; tilt quickly so that batter runs to cover the bottom of the pan thinly but completely.

Cook, turning once, until light brown on both sides.

Repeat, using all the batter.

Brush pan with oil when necessary.

Recipe make about 12 crepes.
