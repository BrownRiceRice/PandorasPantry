--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1 1/2   tablespoons  tomato paste
       1    tablespoon  tamarind pulp
     1/2    tablespoon  shallots -- chopped
     1/4           cup  sherry vinegar
   1 1/4          cups  olive oil
     1/4      teaspoon  kosher salt
       1          Dash  black pepper
       1                red onion
   1 1/2   tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
       6          cups  spinach

FOR THE DRESSING: 
Place the tomato paste, tamarind pulp, shallot, and vinegar in a blender and mix well. Slowly add the oil a drop at a time at first and then in a slow but steady stream until it is all incorporated. Add the salt. Can be kept in the refrigerator for 1 week.

FOR THE ONIONS: 
Peel and slice one large red onion thick enough so that you can handle the slices and they will not fall apart when you cook them. Rub them with a little olive oil and cook the onions over a charcoal fire or under a hot broiler until soft. (Approximately 5 to 6 minutes per side.) Toss in a bowl with 1-1/2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar so that the slices become single rings. These will keep refrigerated 2 to 3 days.

TO ASSEMBLE THE SALAD: 
Wash and dry one medium handful (about 1 cup) spinach for each portion and toss with enough dressing to coat each leaf, being careful not to over-dress the salad. Arrange the onions over the salad and serve. Always serve salads on chilled plates.
