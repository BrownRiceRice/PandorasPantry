      10          cups  water
   1 1/2          cups  mushroom liquid
     1/4           cup  tamari soy sauce, low sodium
     1/4           cup  sherry -- optional
       3                garlic cloves -- crushed
       1    tablespoon  fresh ginger root -- grated
       2      packages  shiitake mushrooms -- dried
       1                onion -- cut in wedges
       1         bunch  green onions -- cut in 1" pieces
       3        stalks  celery -- sliced
     1/2         pound  chinese cabbage -- sliced
     1/2         pound  soba noodles -- ** see note

Pour 2 cups hot water over the mushrooms in a bowl; soak for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, put 10 cups water in a large soup pot. Add tamari, sherry, ginger, and garlic. Bring to a boil. Add onion wedges. Reduce heat. Squeeze excess water from the mushrooms, reserving the liquid. Add 1 1/2 cups of this liquid to the hot broth. Chop mushrooms discarding tough stems, and add to broth. Add remaining ingredients, except for the noodles. Simmer over low heat 15 minutes, add noodles, and cook an additional 10 minutes. Serve hot.
