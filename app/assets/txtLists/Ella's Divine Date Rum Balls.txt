   1 1/2   tablespoons  rum
                        confectioner's sugar -- optional

Melt butter in a pan.   Add sugar, salt and dates.  Cook stirring until smooth and thick.  Remove from heat and stir in nuts, rice krispies and rum.  Stir well.  Let cool and form into balls.  Roll in confectioners' sugar if you like.  Keep in a covered container.

Makes about 3 dozen balls.
