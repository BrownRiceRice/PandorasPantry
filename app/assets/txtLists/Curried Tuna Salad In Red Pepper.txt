     1/2           cup  canned garbanzo beans -- drained

       3   tablespoons  dried currants
       2   tablespoons  slivered almonds -- lightly toasted
       2                scallions -- thinly sliced
       4   tablespoons  plain low-fat yogurt
       1      teaspoon  curry powder
     1/2      teaspoon  ground ginger

CUT OFF THE TOP of the red pepper about one-third of the way down. Remove the seeds and membranes from both the top and bottom, and the stem from the top. Finely dice the top and put it in a medium-size bowl. Add the tuna, garbanzo beans, cucumber, currants, almonds and scallions to the bowl, and toss gently. Combine the yogurt with the curry and ginger, and mix it with the tuna salad. Spoon the tuna back into the red pepper before serving.
