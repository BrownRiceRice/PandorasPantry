       1    tablespoon  active dry yeast -- 1 pk.
     1/4           cup  water; warm -- 110-115 deg. f.
       2           cup  unbleached flour -- sifted
     1/4           cup  sugar -- granulated
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  milk
     1/4           cup  butter
       1                egg; large -- lightly beaten

Lightly grease the baking pan.  Dissolve the yeast in the warm water. In a large mixing bowl, mix the flour, sugar and salt until well blended. In a saucepan, heat the milk and butter, then cool to lukewarm. Add the warm milk and the yeast mixture to the dry ingredients, then add the egg. Blend well to form a moist soft dough. Knead lightly until the dough is soft and smooth.  Return the dough to a clean greased bowl and cover with a damp towel.  Set the dough in a warm place to rise. Let rise for 1 hour or until doubled in size.  When the dough is ready, punch it down and pat it into a thin layer.  Place the layer into the bottom of the pan folding the excess dough up the sides of the pan making it as smooth as possible. Allow the dough to rise again, in the pan until it is doubled, bout 30 to 45 minutes. When the dough is double the crust is ready to be filled.
