       2      packages  active dry yeast
     1/2           cup  warm water
       2          cups  lukewarm milk -- (scaled then
                        -- cooled)
     1/3           cup  sugar
     1/3           cup  vegetable oil or shortening
       3     teaspoons  baking powder
       2     teaspoons  salt
       1                Egg
       5          cups  all-purpose flour -- up to 6
       4   tablespoons  butter -- softened
     1/2           cup  sugar
       1    tablespoon  + 1 Tsp. cinnamon
                        Powder Sugar Frosting

 Dissolve yeast in warm water.  Stir in milk, 1/3 cup sugar, the oil, baking powder, salt, egg and 2 to 3 cups of the flour.  Beat until smooth.  Mix in enough remaining flour to make dough easy to handle.

 Turn dough onto well floured board; knead until smooth and elastic, 8 to 10 minutes.  Place in greased bowl; turn greased side up.  Cover, let rise in warm place until double, about 1 1/2 hours.  (dough is ready if an indention remains when touched.)

 Grease 2 oblong pans, 13x9x2 inches.  Punch down dough; divide into halves.  Roll 1 half into rectangle, 12x10 inches.  Spread with half of the butter.  Mix 1/2 cup sugar and the cinnamon; sprinkle half the sugar-cinnamon mixture over rectangle.  Roll up, beginning at wide side.  Pinch edge of dough into roll to seal.  Stretch roll to make even.

 Cut roll into 12 slices.  Place slightly apart in 1 pan.  Wrap pan tightly with heavy aluminum foil.  Repeat with remaining dough.  Refrigerate at least 12 hours but no longer than 48 hours.  (To bake immediately, do not wrap. Let rise in warm place until double, about 30 minutes.  Bake as directed below.)

 Heat oven to 350 degrees.  Remove foil from pans.  Bake until golden, 30 to 35 minutes.  Frost with Powdered Sugar Frosting while warm.

Makes 24 rolls.

POWDERED SUGAR FROSTING:  Mix 1 cup powdered sugar, 1 Tbsp. milk and 1/2 Tsp. vanilla until smooth and of spreading consistency.  Frost 1 pan of rolls.

VARIETIES OF ICEBOX ROLLS:

CARAMEL PECAN ICEBOX ROLLS:  Omit Powdered Sugar Frosting.  Before rolling dough into rectangles, heat 1 cup brown sugar (packed) and 1/2 cup butter until melted; remove from heat.  Stir in 2 Tbsp. light corn syrup.   Divide caramel mixture between pans.  Sprinkle each with 1/2 cup pecan halves.  Roll dough, slice, refrigerate and bake as directed.  Immediately invert pan on large tray.  Let pan remain over rolls 1 minute so caramel drizzles over rolls.

ORANGE MARMALADE ICEBOX ROLLS:  Omit butter, sugar-cinnamon mixture and Powdered Sugar Frosting.  Before rolling dough into rectangles, beat 2 cups powdered sugar, 1/2 cup orange marmalade and 1/4 cup butter, softened, until smooth and creamy.  Spread each rectangle with 1/3 cup of the marmalade mixture.  Roll dough, slice, refrigerate and bake as directed.  Frost with remaining marmalade mixture while warm.
