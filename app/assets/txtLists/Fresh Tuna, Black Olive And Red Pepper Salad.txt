Rub the tuna with 1 tablespoon of the oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill over hot coals for 8 to 10 minutes, turning once, or broil under a hot broiler for about the same length of time. Allow the tuna to cool, then break into 1-1/2 inch chunks using two forks. In a bowl, combine the tuna, peppers, celery, olives and basil.
