   1 1/2             t  baking powder
     1/2             t  salt
     3/4             t  cinnamon

     1/2           cup  butter or margarine -- softened
     3/4           cup  brown sugar -- dark brown
       2                eggs
     1/3           cup  milk
     3/4           cup  cranberries -- coarsely chopped
     3/4           cup  apple -- finely chopped
     3/4           cup  walnuts -- chopped
                        -----glaze-----
     1/2           cup  powdered sugar
       2             t  milk

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. To make bread, combine flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves in a large bowl until well blended. In another large bowl, beat butter and sugar until light and creamy. Beat un eggs, one at a time, until well blended. Alternately beat flour mixture and milk into butter-and-sugar mixture, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. Stir in cranberries, apples, and walnuts until just combined.  Turn into greased and floured 9x5-inch loaf pan. Bake about 50 minutes, or until a wooden pick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool bread 10 minutes in the pan on a wire rack. Remove loaf from pan and cool completely on rack. To make glaze, combine confectioners' sugar and milk in a bowl until smooth. Drizzle over bread.
