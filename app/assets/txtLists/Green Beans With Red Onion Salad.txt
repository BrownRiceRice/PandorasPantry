       1         pound  fresh green beans
                        Salt -- to taste
       1      teaspoon  Dijon-style mustard

Cut off and discard the tips of the beans.  Break the beans into 2 inch lengths.  Drop beans into boiling salted water to cover and return to a boil.  Simmer about 7 minutes or until crisp and tender.  Do not overcook.  Drain.  Let cool.

To make the dressing, put the mustard in a salad bowl and add the vinegar.  Start beating with a wire whisk while adding the oil.  Add salt and pepper and the onions.

Add the beans and toss until blended.
