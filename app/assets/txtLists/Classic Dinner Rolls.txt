       4          cups  all-purpose flour (4 to 4 1/2 cups)
     1/4           cup  sugar
       2      packages  Fleischmann's. Active Dry or Rapid Rise
                        Yeast
   1 1/2     teaspoons  salt
     3/4           cup  warm milk (105: to 115:F)
     1/2           cup  warm water (105: to 115:F)
     1/3           cup  butter or margarine -- softened
       2                eggs
                        Poppy or sesame seeds -- optional

In large bowl, combine 1 1/2 cups flour, sugar, undissolved yeast and
salt. Gradually add warm milk, warm water and butter to dry ingredients;
beat 2 minutes at medium speed of electric mixer, scraping bowl
occasionally. Add 1 egg and 1/2 cup flour; beat 2 minutes at high speed,
scraping bowl occasionally. With spoon, stir in enough remaining flour to
make soft dough. Grease top; cover tightly with plastic wrap and
refrigerate 2 to 24 hours.

Remove from refrigerator; punch dough down. Remove dough to lightly
floured surface. Shape as desired (directions follow).

Place rolls, about 2 inches apart, on greased baking sheets (or other pans
as directed below). Cover; let rise in warm, draft-free place until
doubled in size, about 20 to 40 minutes.

Beat remaining egg; brush on rolls. If desired, sprinkle with poppy or
sesame seed. Bake at 375:F for 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown.
Remove from sheets or pans; cool on wire racks. 

Makes 1 1/2 to 2 dozen rolls.
