--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       2        pounds  stew meat -- cut in 1-inch chunks
       2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  pepper
       2        medium  onions
       2        medium  tomatoes -- roma best
       2    tablespoon  salad oil -- peanut oil best
       1                unsalted peanuts -- coarsely broken
       4                cooked rice -- hot

In a covered medium saucepan, cook meat, 1 1/2 cups water, salt, and pepper for 1 1/2 hours or until tender. Meanwhile, in covered electric blender container at low speed [nb: this is pre-Cuisinart], blend onions and tomatoes until smooth (or chop onions and tomatoes very fine.) In large skillet over medium-high heat, in hot oil, cook onion-tomato mixture for 5 minutes. Add meat mixture and peanuts, cook about 20 minutes until sauce cooks down slightly. Serve over hot rice.  [Allegedly] 6 Servings. Accompaniments: Pass small bowls of shredded coconut, orange segments, pineapple chunks, and fried onions to sprinkle over individual servings of stew, if you like. You can serve this with the JOLOFF RICE. (See recipe JOLOFF RICE)
