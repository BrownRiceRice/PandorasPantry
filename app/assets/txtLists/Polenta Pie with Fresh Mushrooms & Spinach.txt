--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1         pound  fresh white mushrooms
       1    tablespoon  olive oil
     1/2           cup  freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese -- divided
       1  (10 ounce) p  frozen, chopped spinach -- thawed and squeezed
       1           cup  prepared pesto
       1           cup  instant polenta or cornmeal

Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Lightly coat a 9-inch pie plate with butter or nonstick cooking spray. Trim mushrooms; cut into thin slices. In a large nonstick skillet, heat over high heat until hot. Add mushrooms; cook and stir until tender and lightly browned, about 10 minutes.

Remove 1 cup of the mushrooms to a small bowl; stir in 1 tablespoon of the Parmigiano-Reggiano; set aside. Into mushrooms remaining in skillet, stir in spinach and pesto; cook until hot, about 2 minutes. Cook polenta according to package directions.

Remove from heat; stir in the remaining 7 tablespoons of cheese. Spread half of the polenta in the prepared pie plate. Spoon the mushroom-spinach mixture over the polenta; with a knife, spread the remaining polenta on top; top with the remaining mushroom-Parmiagiano mixture.

Bake, uncovered until heated through, about 10 minutes. Remove from oven and let stand 5 minutes; cut into wedges.
