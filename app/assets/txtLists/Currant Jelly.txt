   4 1/2        quarts  currant to make 6 1/2 cups juice
   1 1/2          cups  water
       7          cups  sugar

TO PREPARE CURRANT FOR JUICE:  Remove stems, crush and place in saucepan.  Add water.  Bring to boil, cover and simmer 10 minutes.

 Place 3 layers of damp cheesecloth or jelly bag in a large bowl.  Pour cooked fruit into cheesecloth.  Tie and hang to let drip into a bowl.  When dripping stops, press gently.  Measure juice and if necessary, add up to 1/2 cup water for exact measure.

 Boil jars on rack in large pot filled with water 10 minutes.  Place flat lids in saucepan with water.  Bring to boil; remove from heat.  Let stand in hot water until ready to fill.  Drain well.

 Combine juice, fruit pectin and butter.  Bring mixture to full rolling boil over high heat, stirring constantly.

 Quickly add sugar to fruit mixture.  Bring to full rolling boil and boil 1 minute, stirring constantly.  Remove from heat.  Skim off any foam.

 Fill all jars quickly to 1/8" of tops.  Wipe jar rims.  Cover quickly with flat lids.  Screw bands tightly.  Invert jars for 5 minutes, then turn upright.  After 1 hour check seals.  Or use water bath method.
