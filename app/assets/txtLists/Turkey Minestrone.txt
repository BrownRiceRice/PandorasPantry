--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Meaty turkey frame
       1      teaspoon  salt
       4          cups  water
       2          cups  sliced potatoes
       3                Onions -- thinly sliced
       1           Bag  -- (8 oz.) shredded
                        -- coleslaw cabbage
       2          cups  sliced celery
       6                Ripe pitted medium olives -- chopped

Combine turkey frame, salt and water in a soup pot (or pressure cooker).  Cover and simmer 2 hours over low heat, or 45 minutes in a pressure cooker, (following manufacturer's directions.)

Strain broth into a container.  Set turkey frame aside to cool.  When fat has risen to the surface of the turkey broth, skim with a bulb-type baster (or if you're not in a hurry, chill until fat hardens.  Then lift off the fat.)

Combine fat free broth with remaining ingredients.  Cover and simmer until vegetables are tender.

Meanwhile, strip meat from turkey frame and chop into bite-size pieces.  Add to the soup and heat through.

Salt and pepper to taste.

Season with Parmesan cheese and chopped fresh parsley if you like.
