                        topping (cool whip)
   1 1/2           cup  cold espresso coffee
       6                egg yolks
       4    tablespoon  brandy
   1 1/4           cup  sugar
                        topping- powdered unsweetened
   1 1/4           cup  mascarpone cheese -- softened
                        cocoa
      12         ounce  whipped cream or non dairy
      48                ladyfingers (2-7 oz pks)

Cream yolks and sugar until smooth. Add mascarpone cheese and mix on low speed for 2 min. Fold in cream (or whipped topping) Combine coffee and brandy in a bowl. Dip 15 ladyfingers, one by one into brandy mixture and line up on a platter to make a rectangle about 7 by 13 ". Cover with 1/2 the mascarpone/cream mixture. Repeat with another layer and top with remaining cream mixture. Sift chocolate on top. With remaining ladyfingers, cut them in half and arrange around your rectangle with cut side down. The cream  around the edges of the layers acts as a "glue". Refrigerate for about 4 hours. To serve, cut into squares.
