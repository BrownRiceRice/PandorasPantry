--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       2   tablespoons  olive oil
       8        ounces  fresh white mushrooms -- sliced (about 2 1/2
       1      teaspoon  minced garlic
       1          loaf  Italian bread (8 to 10 ounces)
                        OR
       4                individual Italian rolls
       1  15 ounce can  black beans -- drained, rinsed and
                        lightly crushed
       1   4 ounce can  chopped mild green chilies -- drained
     1/4           cup  chunky mild or medium salsa
       2          cups  (8 ounces) shredded Monterey jack cheese

Preheat oven to 350:F. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat oil
until hot. Add mushrooms and garlic; cook, stirring occasionally, until
the mushroom liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes. 

Cut bread in half horizontally; scoop out center leaving a 1/2-inch thick
shell; set aside.

In a medium bowl combine black beans, green chilies and salsa.

Sprinkle about half the cheese over the bottom half of the bread. Spoon
about half the mushroom mixture over cheese. Spread bean mixture over
mushrooms; top with remaining mushrooms, then remaining cheese.

Gently press top of bread over filling; wrap tightly in aluminum foil.
Bake until heated through and cheese has melted, about 15 minutes. Remove
from foil and cut the Italian loaf into quarters; serve with mixed greens
and fruit, if desired.
