--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       3          cups  self-rising flour
       1    tablespoon  sugar -- optional
       1           can  beer -- at room temperature
       1                egg -- beat w/ 1 tb water

Combine flour and sugar, pour in beer and stir just until dry ingreds. are moist (about 17 times according to original recipe). Pour batter into greased & floured loaf pan and let sit for about 15 min. to rise. Dough will be very gooey.  Brush top with egg mixture and bake in pre-heated 375 oven for about an hour or until pick comes out clean. When done, brush top with butter.

I like to add things like 2 cups shredded cheddar cheese and 2 tblsp. caraway seeds or the cheese and some fresh chopped jalapenos or just use your imagination.  If you add these things, add them to the flour and mix well before you add the beer.
