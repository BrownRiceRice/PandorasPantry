  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1         whole  acorn, butternut, or banana squash
       2   tablespoons  butter
       2   tablespoons  brown sugar
     1/8      teaspoon  salt

Preheat oven to 400:F. Halve squash and remove the seeds. Melt a very small portion of the butter (about a sixth), brush each half of the squash with the butter, sprinkle with salt and place flat side down in a baking dish. Bake for about 45 minutes. Check with a fork to see if it glides gently through the flesh. Turn right side up, divide the rest of the unmelted butter evenly, place in cavity and sprinkle with the brown sugar. Return to oven for 5 minutes. Serve immediately.
