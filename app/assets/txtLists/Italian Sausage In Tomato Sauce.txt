--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       2        pounds  italian sausage
       2   tablespoons  olive oil
       2          cups  tomato sauce
       1      teaspoon  oregano
       1           cup  chablis wine
       1         pound  mushrooms, fresh and sliced

Saute Italian sausage for a few minutes in olive oil - just long enough to seal it or firm it up.  Remove sausage and let cool. Cut into bite-size pieces.  Mix the rest of the ingredients in the skillet.  Bring to a boil.  Add sausage and cook for 1 hour on low heat. Serve as a hot appetizer. You may wish to be cautious with the wine at first.  Some may find 1 cup too much. From Justin Wilson's Outdoor Cooking With Inside Help.
