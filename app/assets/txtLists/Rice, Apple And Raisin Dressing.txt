                        -------seasoning mix--------
       2     teaspoons  salt
   1 1/2     teaspoons  white pepper
       1      teaspoon  garlic powder
       1      teaspoon  dry mustard
       1      teaspoon  ground cayenne pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  black pepper
                        ------rice ingredients------
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
       1           cup  chopped onions
       1           cup  chopped green bell peppers
     1/2           cup  pecan halves, dry roasted
     1/2           cup  raisins
       4   tablespoons  unsalted butter
   1 1/2          cups  uncooked rice (converted)
       3          cups  beef stock
       2          cups  chopped unpeeled apples

Combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl and set aside. In a 2-quart saucepan, heat the oil over high heat until very hot, about 2 minutes.  Add the onions and bell peppers; saute about 2 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add the pecans (we ran out of pecans, so Lucy substituted hickory nuts - good!) and continue cooking for about 3 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add the raisins and butter (these are added together so the raisins will absorb as much butter as possible).  Stir until butter is melted, then cook until raisins are plump, about 4 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add the rice and seasoning mix and cook until rice starts looking frizzly (a bit like rice Krispies)  Chef Prudhomme recommended using converted rice.  Lucy used brown, long grain rice - super!.  This will require about 2 to 3 minutes, stirring almost constantly before the rice looks "frizzly". Stir in the stock, scraping pan bottom well, then stir in the apples. Cover pan and bring to boil; lower heat and simmer covered for 5 minutes.  Remove from heat and let sit, *COVERED*, until rice is tender and stock is absorbed, about 30 minutes.  (We cook the rice this slow way to let the flavors build to their maximum.)   Serve immediately, allowing about 3/4 cup per person.
