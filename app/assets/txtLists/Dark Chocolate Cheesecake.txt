IS IT CHEESECAKE, OR IS IT FUDGE? 1. Prepare Vanilla Cookie Crust: press mixture evenly onto bottom and 2 inches up side of a buttered 9-inch springform pan. 2. Melt chocolate over hot, not boiling, water; cool. 3. Preheat oven to very slow (275~). 4. Beat cream cheese, sugar, eggs and vanilla in a large bowl with electric mixer until smooth. Stir in cooled melted chocolate and sour cream until blended. Pour into prepared pan. 5. Bake in preheated very slow oven (275~) for 1 hour and 45 minutes. Turn off heat; let cake cool in oven with door ajar. Remove from oven to wire rack; cool to room temperature; refrigerate. Garnish with whipped cream and chocolate curls, if you wish.
