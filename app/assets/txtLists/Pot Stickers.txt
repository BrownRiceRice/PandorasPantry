  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1           cup  whole-wheat flour pastry
       1           cup  unbleached white flour
     1/2           cup  plus 1 tablespoon warm water
     1/3           cup  Cooking Sherry
     1/2           cup  Onion -- minced
     1/2           cup  Cabbage -- green, thin sliced
       2                Garlic Cloves -- minced
       1    tablespoon  Ginger Root -- grated fresh
     1/2           cup  Celery -- minced
       3   tablespoons  Green Onion -- minced
       3   tablespoons  Cilantro -- minced
       5         large  Mushrooms -- coarsely chopped
       2   tablespoons  Low Sodium Soy Sauce
   1 1/2   tablespoons  Salt or herbal salt substitute

In large bowl, combine flours and water. Knead 15 minutes, adding more flour to water to create a smooth, pliable dough. Cover dough tightly with plastic wrap and let rest for 20 minutes. Heat sherry in a wok over medium heat. Stir-fry onion and cabbage until limp.

Add remaining pot sticker ingredients. Cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Remove mixture from heat and place in colander to drain excess moisture. Divide dough into 24 small balls. On a lightly floured board, flatten each ball of dough into a 3-4" circle. Fill each circle with about 1 tablespoon filling.

Fold circle into half-moon shape; pinch edges to seal. Lightly coat two large nonstick skillets (or work in batches with one skillet) with vegetable coating spray.

Set over medium heat. When hot, add pot stickers seam side up, flattening slightly on the bottom. When bottom of pot stickers are golden brown, add 1/2 cup water per pan. Cover and steam for 20 minutes.
