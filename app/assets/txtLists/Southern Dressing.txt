                        Souther Egg Bread -- see recipe
       1         large  onion -- chopped
       3        stalks  celery -- chopped
       4                eggs
     1/2         slice  bread
                        stock from turkey
       1         stick  butter
                        salt and pepper -- to taste
                        turkey giblets -- optional

Put your egg bread in large mixing bowl.  Break your 1/2 slice of bread in small pieces.  add eggs, butter, stock, onions and celery.  Add some salt and pepper to taste. 

I always use a potato masher to get it mixed well.  I always put enough stock to make my dressing slightly soupy.

Place in the oven at 350 degrees until done.

You can add some giblets if you like.
