       3                eggs, hard-boiled, chopped
       2   tablespoons  mayonnaise
       2   tablespoons  dill relish (heaping)
       1      teaspoon  Louisiana hot sauce
       2     teaspoons  poupon mustard
       1  6 1/2 oz can  tuna, drained

Combine eggs and dill relish.  Add the rest of the ingredients, except tuna, and mix really well.  Then add tuna.  If the mixture is dry, add some more mayonnaise. This is fine for a sandwich.
