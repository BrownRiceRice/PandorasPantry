       1      teaspoon  oil
       2     teaspoons  sherry
       1           cup  onion -- chopped
       1           cup  carrot -- sliced
       2        stalks  celery -- sliced
       2          cups  red potatoes -- cubed
       1                bay leaf
       1           cup  vegetable broth
       1           cup  skim milk
       1           cup  corn kernels
                        cayenne to taste
                        plain yogurt for garnish (optional)

Instructions In large heavy saucepan, heat oil and sherry until bubbling. Add onion and saute 5 minutes.  (If mixture appears dry, add 1-2 tsp. water.)  Add carrot, celery, bay leaf, potatoes & stock. Cover, bring to boil & cook over medium heat for 10-15 minutes, or until potato is tender.  Add milk & corn; simmer for 3 minutes or until corn is tender. Discard bay leaf.  Puree 1 cup soup in blender, then return to pot.  Season with cayenne.  If desired, garnish with yogurt. 

Note: Go easy on the cayenne. The first time I made this I overdid it!  I didn't use the yogurt, and it tasted fine.
