--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  active sourdough starter
     1/2           cup  sugar
       2   tablespoons  shortening
       2          cups  unbleached flour
       1      teaspoon  baking powder
       1         large  egg
     1/2      teaspoon  nutmeg
     1/4      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/3           cup  buttermilk or sour milk

Sift dry ingredients, stir into liquid, roll out and cut with regular donut cutter.  Then heat some oil in a deep fryer to 390 degrees F and fry. Makes about 17 Doughnuts with holes. Just before serving dust with powdered or cinnamon sugar. NOTE: These doughnuts are virtually greaseless. And if you want you can make several batches at a time and freeze. They keep well and to me taste better after awhile in the freezer. Take out as many as needed and thaw and put sugar on or eat plain.
