     1/2           cup  shortening

   1 1/2          cups  sugar
       3          cups  flour

       1      teaspoon  vanilla
       1           cup  figs -- finely chopped

I got this one from my grandmother many years ago. She used this and it always turned out super. Cream shortening and 1 cup sugar. Add egg and beat until light and fluffy. Mix milk and vanilla. Sift salt, flour and baking powder together. Add alternately with milk to creamed mixture. Blend all well. Roll out to 1/8 inch thickness on lightly floured board. (Rectangle shape) Put figs in saucepan with remaining sugar and 1 cup boiling water. Boil 5 minutes. Cool. Spread cooked mixture over half the dough. Cover with the other half of the dough. Cut into oblong bars. Bake in 400 oven for 12 - 15 minutes.
