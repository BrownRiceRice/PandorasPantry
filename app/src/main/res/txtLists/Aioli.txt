--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1   thick slice  french bread
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
                        milk
       1           cup  olive oil
       4        cloves  garlic
       1    tablespoon  boiling water
       2                egg yolks
                        lemon juice

I find a recipe in my Encyclopedia of Cooking by JoAnna Morris for aioli. Here it is: Remove the crusts from bread and soak in milk. Squeeze dry. Place in large mortar with garlic & mash with pestle until a fine paste.  Add the yolks & salt & mash in. Drop by drop pound in olive oil.  When the sauce becomes thick; the remaining oil may be beaten in. Thin with water & lemon juice to taste. FROM: PAM HOUGLAN (KFNR49B)
