--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   3 1/2          cups  milk -- very warm
     2/3           cup  sugar -- or honey
     2/3           cup  vegetable oil -- not olive
       4     teaspoons  salt
     3/4         ounce  dry yeast
   1 1/2          cups  whole-grain flour -- graham
   1 1/2          cups  bread flour
                        remainder all purpose white flour

Mix all the non-flour items (make sure the milk is not too hot to the touch, or it will kill the yeast).  Mix in the whole wheat and bread flour.  Then knead in enough of the all purpose flour so  that the dough does not stick appreciably to your hands (this may take 10 minutes of kneading).  Put the dough into a really large bowl, rub some oil on the top of the dough so it doesn't get crusty (dry out) when rising. Cover the bowl with some waxed paper (etc.) and put in a warm place. When approx. doubled in size, form portions of dough into loaves and put in pans (This makes about 6 small loaves for me). Put pans with dough in them in a warm place (I just put them in the oven at this point and don't turn the gas on until its risen).  Let them rise until about doubled.  Bake at 325F for small loaves, 300F for big loaves (my oven's a bit hot, so you may need a slightly higher temperature) on the bottom rack in the oven until the tops are all brown.  After taking the pans out of the oven, let cool for about 5 minutes then take the bread out of the pans  and lay them on their sides on cooling racks.  When they're cool, I put most of them in zip-lock bags and freeze them for the week.
