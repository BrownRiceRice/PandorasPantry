--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1      envelope  dry yeast
     1/4      teaspoon  sugar
     3/4           cup  lukewarm water -- 75-80 degrees f
   1 3/4          cups  unbleached all-purpose flour -- or bread flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt

Stir yeast and sugar into water, let sit for 8 minutes or so. It should become slightly foamy with a familiar "yeast" odor. No foam after 6 or so minutes and the yeast was bad or your water wrong temperature.  I haven't had a yeast problem yet.

In a bowl (or food processor) mix 1 3/4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour or bread flour 1/2 teaspoon salt

Add the yeast mixture.  If using food processor, continue running until dough forms a ball, 10-20 seconds.  By hand, just jump in and mix away.  If you've never done dough before, it gets a little sticky.

If the dough is a little dry (ie: flour left on sides of bowl and you absolutely can't get it mixed) add 1/2 teaspoon water and try until you get it.  If measured right, you shouldn't need any additional water.

On a floured surface pick up dough and throw it down HARD 8-10 times (really, you can't hurt it, think of your boss...)  Continue kneading for 2 minutes or so. if dough is a little sticky, dust your finger and counter with flour, but as little as possible).

That it.  Either rolls out by hand for an 11" pizza (14" thin or 7" thick). Bake at 500F in pre-heated oven for 8-12 minutes, the edges will turn nice golden brown when done.  Dough will be firm and crispy, not soggy and soft like many other doughs.
