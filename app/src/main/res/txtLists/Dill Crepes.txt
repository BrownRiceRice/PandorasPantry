       3                Eggs
     1/2           cup  milk

 If using blender, combine all ingredients in blender container.  Blend about 1 minute.  Scrape down sides of container with rubber spatula, if necessary.  Blend until smooth, about 30 additional seconds.

 Bake immediately or refrigerate batter 1 hour.

 If you have special crepe pan, follow manufacture's directions.

 Otherwise, on medium-high heat, heat buttered 10" omelet pan (or 8" crepe pan) until just hot enough to sizzle drop of water.

 For each crepe pour scant 1/4 cup (2 Tbsp. in 8" pan) batter in pan, rotating pan as batter is poured.

 Cook until lightly browned on bottom.

 Remove from pan or, if desired, turn and brown on other side. (Crepes to be filled need only be browned on 1 side. Use unbrowned side for filling.)

 Stir batter frequently to keep dill distributed.

 tack between sheets of paper toweling or waxed paper until ready to use.

 Crepes may be frozen.

Yield:  2 cups batter.
