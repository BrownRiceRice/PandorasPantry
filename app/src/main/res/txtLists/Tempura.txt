       1         pound  shrimp -- prepared w/tails
       1           cup  asparagus -- 1" pieces
       1           cup  carrots -- 1/4" slices
       1           cup  celery -- 1/4" slices
       1           cup  cauliflower -- flowerettes
       1           cup  zucchini -- 1/2x2" sticks
       1           cup  green beans -- 2" pieces
       1           cup  green onions -- 2" pieces
       1                bell pepper -- cut into rings
       1                onion; medium -- cut into ring
       1                parsley -- bunch
       1           cup  snow peas
       1                sweet potato -- 1/8" slices
                        vegetable oil
       1                tempura batter recipe
       1                tempura sauce recipe

Make several crosswise slits on the underside of shrimp to prevent curling.  Parboil green beans.  Pat shrimp and vegetables dry; arrange on platter; cover and refrigerate until serving time. Prepare batter and sauce recipes.  Do not make batter recipe too far ahead of time. Heat oil in a wok to 360 degrees.  Dip shrimp and vegetables into batter with tongs; allow excess batter to drip into bowl. Fry a few pieces at a time until golden brown, turning once (cooking time approximately 2-3 minutes).     This is best prepared close to or at the table. It is great fun to have a "tempura party" with guests cooking their own. Serve with sauce and rice. (you may need more batter mix depending on the amounts of seafood and vegetables you prepare).  Does not keep well once cooked.
