--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1 1/3           cup  water
       2    tablespoon  olive oil
     2/3      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  oregano
       4           cup  bread flour
   2 1/2      teaspoon  yeast
                        -----spinach filling-----
  10 1/2         ounce  frozen chopped spinach
                        garlic powder
       2    tablespoon  olive oil
       1           cup  provolone cheese -- grated +-
       1           cup  mozzarella cheese -- grated +-

Remove dough from machine and roll it into circles of approximately 8 inches. Spread filling on one half of the circle leaving a border around it for closing. Close the >> calzone by folding the unfilled side on top of the filled side and crimping the edges closed with your fingers or a fork. Place on a lightly greased baking pan. Let rise approx. 30 minutes. Brush lightly with olive oil and bake at 500 degrees for 20-30 minutes or until puffed and golden. (I bake them at 485 degrees for 15 minutes in my oven.)  The original recipe says to put 1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons each or ricotta and grated mozzarella cheese in each calzone. >> My favorite filling is the following......

 SPINACH FILLING : Saute thawed spinach in olive oil and garlic powder until all water has evaporated. (I squeeze out excess liquid first) Mix cheeses into spinach. You may substitute frozen chopped broccoli for spinach.

 I LOVE these!!! I serve them with a spaghetti sauce that has sausage, peppers, onions, mushrooms, etc. and they are GREAT! Hope you enjoy them! I used to eat them at the mall and wish I knew how to make them! Let us know what you think!  This recipe that we use is found in Donna German's book II.
