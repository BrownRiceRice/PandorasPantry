       1           cup  butter -- melted
     3/4           cup  brown sugar -- firmly packed
   1 1/2          cups  pecans, chopped fine -- *
   2 1/2          cups  all-purpose flour -- sifted

* divided in 3/4 cup portions This is an easy yet elegant butter-pecan cookie shaped to resemble an acorn and dipped in melted chocolate chips and chopped pecans. Preheat oven to 375. In a large bowl, beat together butter, brown sugar, 3/4 cup chopped pecans and vanilla on medium speed until well blended. Add flour and baking powder and mix well, using low speed. Shape dough into 1-inch balls. Slightly flatten by pressing balls onto ungreased cookie sheets; pinch tops to point to resemble acorns. Bake for 10-12 minutes at 375.  Remove from oven and cool on wire racks. In top of a double boiler over simmering water, melt chocolate chips, stirring until smooth. Remove from heat; keep double boiler over water. Dip large ends of cooled cookies into melted chocolate, then roll in chopped pecans. Cool to set chocolate. Yield: 3 dozen.
