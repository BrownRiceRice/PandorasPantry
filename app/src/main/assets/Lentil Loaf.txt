       2          cups  dry brown lentils -- rinsed
       1                bay leaf
       1           cup  uncooked fine bulgur wheat
       1           cup  soft whole-wheat bread
                        crumbs
       1                egg substitute -- beaten
       1    tablespoon  ketchup
       1        medium  onion -- chopped
       1         clove  garlic -- crushed
       1      teaspoon  dried thyme
       2     teaspoons  dried oregano
       1      teaspoon  dried tarragon
                        salt and pepper to taste
       3   tablespoons  tomato paste or tomato
                        sauce

Prep:  Cook lentils and bay leaf in pot with 6 cups water.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer until lentils are soft and water has been absorbed, about 45 min.

 Combine bulgur and 2 cups water in  a med. saucepan.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer for about 15 min.

 Preheat oven to 350F.  Transfer lentils to a large mixing bowl.  Add bulgur, and remaining ingredients except tomato paste or sauce.  Mix well with your hands until thoroughly combined.  Pat mixture into a 9" loaf pan.

 Bake for 40 min. until firm but not dry.  During last minutes of baking, brush top with tomato paste or sauce.  Let cool for 15 min.  Cut into slices and serve warm.

 This goes wonderfully with mashed potatoes and your favorite vegetable! The leftovers taste so good in a pita pocket, and if there are mashed potatoes leftover, I stuff the pocket with both.   Mmmm!   Enjoy!  Nutrition Info per serving:
