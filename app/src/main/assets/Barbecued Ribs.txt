       4        pounds  pork ribs, cut in pieces
       1                lemon
       1         large  onion
       1           cup  catsup
     1/3           cup  worcestershire sauce
       1      teaspoon  chili powder
       1      teaspoon  salt
       2        dashes  tabasco sauce
       2          cups  water

Place ribs in shallow roasting pan, meaty side up.  On each piece, place a slice of unpeeled lemon, a thin slice of onion. Roast in very hot oven, 450 F degrees, 30 minutes. Combine remaining ingredients; bring to a boil and pour over ribs.  Continue baking in a moderate oven, 350 F degrees, about 2 hours, basting ribs with the sauce every 15 minutes.
