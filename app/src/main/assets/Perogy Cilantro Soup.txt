       2        cloves  garlic -- diced
     1/3           cup  fresh cilantro -- diced
     1/2    tablespoon  butter -- or oil
       2                tomatoes -- diced
       6                perogys -- 2 of which are diced
       1          dash  tabasco

In your favourite soup cooking dish (preferably something with a nice thick base), melt butter/heat oil or medium-high heat.  Add onion, garlic, and cilantro and fry until soft.  Add tomatoes.  Turn heat down to just below medium.  Fry some more, for a minute or so, then add 1.5 cups of water. Take 2 of the perogys and chop 'em up into little bits.  Add all of the perogys to the soup, and a small dash of tabasco.  Simmer for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Enjoy.
