       4         bulbs  garlic -- left whole
       2   tablespoons  olive oil
                        OR
       2   tablespoons  clarified butter
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  black pepper
       1                French bread loaf -- sliced and heated
       6        ounces  cream cheese or soft cheese (optional)
                        OR
     1/2           cup  butter -- softened

Heat the oven to 350:F. Trim the tops of the garlic heads, leaving them
whole but removing about 1/4 inch. Remove excess dry skins. Rub the heads
with a little of the butter or oil and put in a very small baking dish or
crock the size of the four heads. Drizzle with the rest of the oil or
butter, sprinkle with salt and pepper, cover loosely, reduce heat to 275:F
and bake for 20 minutes. Remove cover and bake for about 1 hour and 15
minutes. Slice and heat the French bread (optional) in the last 10 minutes
of the baking garlic.

To serve: Spread French bread with soft creamy cheese (optional) or butter
and squeeze clove by clove onto the bread and spread it.
