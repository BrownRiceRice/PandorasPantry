--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1         pound  beef liver
       2         large  eggs -- shells washed
       1           cup  cottage cheese, lowfat
   1 1/2          cups  wheat germ
   3 1/4          cups  whole-wheat flour

Rinse liver and cut into 1-inch chunks. Put in a 2-quart pan with 1 cup water, and bring to a boil on high heat. Reduce heat, cover and simmer gently until liver is no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Put liver in a blender, saving the liquid from previous step. Break in eggs, including shells. Whirl to puree, adding reserved liquid as needed. Scrape mixture into bowl, adding remaining cooking liquid, cottage cheese, wheat germ and 3 cups flour. Stir until evenly moistened. Knead until dough no longer feels sticky, adding more flour as required. Roll out dough onto a floured board until 1/2 inch thick. Cut dough with floured bone-shaped cookie cutter. Bake in 300 degree oven until bones are tinged darker brown and feel firm to touch, about 1 hour. Cool on racks.  Once cool, bones should be hard when pressed; if not, bake 10 minutes more at 300 degrees and cool.

(Makes about 4 1/2 dozen 3 1/2 inch long bones.)
