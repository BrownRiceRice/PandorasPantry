       3          cups  sugar
       1           Cup  milk
       4        ounces  unsweetened chocolate
       3   tablespoons  corn syrup
     1/2           cup  butter or margarine
       1      teaspoon  vanilla

 In 3-quart saucepan combine sugar, milk, chocolate and syrup.  Over medium-high heat bring to boil, stirring often.  Reduce heat to medium, set candy thermometer in pan and cook, stirring occasionally, until syrup reaches 234 degrees or forms a soft ball when small amount is dropped in very cold water.  Remove from heat.

 Add butter and vanilla but do not stir.

 Cool at room temperature (without stirring) until temperature drops to 110 degrees or bottom of pan feels just warm, about 1 hour.

`With wooden spoon beat until creamy and frosting begins to hold its shape.
