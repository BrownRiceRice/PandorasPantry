       5          cups  peaches -- sliced
                        or pears or berries
     3/4           cup  sugar
       1    tablespoon  cornstarch
       1           cup  flour
       2   tablespoons  sugar
       1      teaspoon  baking powder
       2   tablespoons  butter -- softened
     1/2           cup  milk

  Combine fruit, 3/4 cup sugar and cornstarch in a saucepan.   Cover and cook over low heat until mixture comes to a boil.      In a mixing bowl, combine dry ingredients and then cut in butter with a pastry blender.  When mix is crumbly, add milk, making a dough that's soft but not sticky  (you may not need all the milk).      Uncover pot and drop spoonfuls of dough onto bubbling fruit, spacing evenly.  Simmer uncovered for 10 minutes, then cover and cook an additional 10 minutes without lifting the lid. Serve warm with whipped cream or ice cream.
