                        -----for pasta-----
   1 1/3           cup  flour
       1    tablespoon  butter
       1         pinch  salt
                        marsala wine
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
       1                egg white -- beaten
       1    tablespoon  grated orange or lemon rind
                        oil -- for frying
                        -----for filling-----
       1         pound  ricotta cheese
       1    tablespoon  candied citron -- or glaced
       2    tablespoon  miniature chocolate bits -- or
                        fruit -- slivered
                        shaved semi-sweet chocolate
       2    tablespoon  sugar

PASTA: Combine flour, salt, sugar, citrus rind and butter and blend well. Add Marsala by the teaspoonful until dough is stiff. Chill for 2 hours. Roll dough on a lightly-floured board into a large rectangle. Cut into 4" squares. Wrap squares around cannoli tubes so that 2 corners fold over and two corners point outward. Brush the touching corners with egg white so that they will stick together. Deep fry in hot oil until golden. Cool and remove from tubes. Fill. Makes 10 to 12 cannoli. If you don't have cannoli tubes, make 2" diameter tubes out of heavy-duty aluminum foil and fold dough accordingly. FILLING: Combine all ingredients and fill the cannoli.
