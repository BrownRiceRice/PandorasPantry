       4         large  baking potatoes
     1/2           cup  diced cooked turkey -- or chicken or pork
     1/2           cup  diced cooked ham
     1/4         pound  sharp cheddar cheese -- diced, (1 cup)
     1/4         pound  provolone cheese -- diced, (1 cup)
       1         large  green pepper -- seeded
                        and diced
       1        medium  onion -- chopped
     1/2           cup  butter or margarine
                        commercial sour cream -- or yogurt, for
                        topping
                        chopped chives
                        crumbled cooked bacon

Scrub potatoes under cold water and place, wet on a baking sheet. Bake potatoes at 400 degrees until done, about 1 hour. Let potatoes cool to the touch. Cut potatoes in half lengthwise and scoop out pulp, leaving nice little boats. Divide pulp in half, reserving half for other use. Put a pat of butter in each shell. Mash remaining potato pulp and mix with onion, pepper, meat, half the cheese and a spoon or two of the sour cream. Spoon into each shell, leaving a well in the middle. Divide remaining cheese into the wells and put a pat of butter on top. Chill overnight. Heat at 375 degrees until heated through. Top with sour cream, bacon, and chives and serve with a nice green salad and a crusty bread.
