Pound the slices of meat as thin as possible. Make a mixture of bread crumbs, egg and oil. Lay meat out and lightly salt and pepper each piece. Place some of the mixture on each piece and spread covering most of the meat except the edges. Roll and secure with a toothpick. Lightly brown each in a bit of butter and oil.
