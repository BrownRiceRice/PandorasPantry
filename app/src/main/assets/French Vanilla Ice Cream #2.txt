--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       3          cups  heavy cream
       1           Cup  milk
     1/4           cup  sugar
       2                Vanilla beans -- split lengthwise,
                        -- or
       2   tablespoons  vanilla extract
       4         large  egg yolks

NOTE:  To make a lighter ice cream, use 2 cups of milk and 2 cups of cream.  To make a richer ice cream, add 2 more egg yolks.

 In a heavy-bottomed 2-quart saucepan, heat cream, milk, sugar and vanilla beans.  (If you're using vanilla extract, do not add it until later on in the recipe.)  Stir occasionally until sugar is dissolved and mixture is hot but not boiling.

 Whisk yolks together in bowl.  Continue whisking and very slowly pour in about 1 cup of the cream mixture.  When smooth, pour back into to the saucepan.

 Whisk constantly over low heat until mixture thickens slightly and coats the back of a spoon (about 5 minutes).  Take care that mixture doesn't boil, or it will curdle.  Draw your finger across the back of the coated spoon.  If the line you make remains, custard is done.

 Remove vanilla beans; or is you're using vanilla extract, add it now.

 Freeze in ice cream churn according to manufacturer's instructions.
