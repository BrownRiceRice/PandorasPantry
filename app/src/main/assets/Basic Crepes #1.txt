--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       2          Cups  All-Purpose Flour
     1/2      Teaspoon  Salt
       4         Large  Eggs
       1           Cup  Milk -- cold
       1           Cup  Cold Water
       4   Tablespoons  Butter -- melted
                        Salad Oil

Combine flour, salt and eggs; blend well.

Blend in milk, water and butter.  Mix well.

Refrigerate batter for at least 2 hours, allowing the flour particles to swell and soften so that the crepes are light in texture.

Brush the bottom of a 6 or 7" crepe pan or heavy skillet lightly with salad oil and heat pan over medium heat until just hot, not smoking.

Pour scant 1/4 cup of batter in pan and quickly tilt pan in all directions to run batter all over bottom of pan in a thin film.

Cook for about 1 minute.  Lift edge of crepe to test for doneness.

The crepe is ready for flipping when it can be shaken loose from the bottom of pan.

Flip the crepe and cook for about 1/2 minute on other side; this is rarely more than a spotty brown and is used as side on which filling is placed.

Crepes can be made in advance and stacked between layers of waxed paper to prevent them from sticking.

Crepes can be frozen; heat them in a covered dish at 300 degrees to thaw.

Yield;  about 22 crepes
