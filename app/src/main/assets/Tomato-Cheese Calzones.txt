--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  mozzarella cheese -- grated
                        skim
   5 1/2        ounces  goat cheese -- crumbled
     1/4         pound  hard salami -- diced
     1/2           cup  sun-dried tomatoes in oil -- drained will,
                        chopped
       2        pounds  pizza dough -- thawed if frozen.

Preheat oven to 450F.  In medium bowl, combine cheese, salmi and tomatoes; toss. Divide dough into 6 pieces. On floured surface, with floured rolling pin, roll each piece of dough into 7 inch round. Top left half of each round with cheese mixture, dividing evenly. Moisten edges with water; fold right side of dough over so edges meet. Press edges to seal; crimp. Place on large baking sheet; with scissors, make three 1/2 inch slits in top of each. Bake 20-25 minutes or until well-browned.
