--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  baby lima beans
     1/4           cup  small white beans
     1/4           cup  black-eyed beans
     1/4           cup  garbanzo beans
     1/4           cup  pink beans
     1/4           cup  light red kidney beans
       1      teaspoon  salt
       1           cup  onion -- chopped
       1           cup  celery -- chopped
       1           cup  carrot -- chopped
     1/2           cup  green bell pepper -- chopped
     1/2           cup  dried parsley -- minced
       1         clove  garlic -- crushed
       2   tablespoons  butter or margarine
       2     envelopes  chicken noodle soup mix -- 2 ounces each
     1/2                bay leaf -- crumbled
     1/2      teaspoon  fines herbes
       1           cup  tomato* -- chopped
                        parmesan cheese -- grated

To soak beans:  For each pound of dry beans, any variety, add 10 cups hot
water.  Up to 2 teaspoons of salt per pound of beans may be added to help the beans absorb water more evenly.  Heat to boiling, let boil 2 to 3 minutes.
Remove from heat, cover and set aside for at least one hour, but preferably
four hours or more.  The longer soaking time is recommended to allow a greater amount of sugars to dissolve, thus helping the beans to be more easily digested.  Always discard the soak water.  To maintain color integrity, soak beans separately. 

Drain beans.  Cook onion, celery, carrot, green pepper, parsley and garlic in
butter until soft.  Combine cooked vegetables with soup mix, 2 quarts water,
bay leaf, fine herbs and soaked beans.  Simmer, covered, about 1 hour to
desired tenderness.  Add tomato.  Serve hot, sprinkled with cheese.
