--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1       package  chocolate chips
       5   tablespoons  hot coffee
       4                eggs -- separated
       2   tablespoons  orange liquor

Over very hot water, melt chocolate with hot coffee. (I melt the chocolate in the microwave--High for 1 minute--and then stir in coffee.) Add liquor. (Original recipe called for rum.) Add egg yolks, and beat very well. Beat egg whites separately and fold chocolate mixture into whites. Pour into sherbet glasses and chill. Serves 4-6. NOTE:  The first 4 ingredients may be combined in blender and mixed on high speed for about 1 minutes. (This is how I do it.) Garnish with dollop of non-dairy Cool Whip and some shaved chocolate. I like to serve it in stemmed glasses.
