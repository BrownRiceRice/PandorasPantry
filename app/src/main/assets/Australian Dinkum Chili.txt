       1                bell pepper(s)
       2        pounds  top beef sirloin -- 1" cubes
       1         pound  beef -- hamburger grind
       1         pound  pork -- hamburger grind
       4   tablespoons  red chile,hot -- ground
       3   tablespoons  red chile,mild -- ground
       2                garlic cloves,med -- fine chop
       1    tablespoon  oregano,dried -- pref. mexican
       1      teaspoon  cumin -- ground
       2          cans  beer -- pref. aus.(12oz ea)
       1           can  tomatoes -- whole(14 1/2oz ea)
       3     teaspoons  brown sugar
       1                boomerang(opt but authentic)

1. Fry the bacon in a skillet over medium heat. Drain the strips on paper toweling and cut into 1/2" dice and reserve.~ 2. Heat the oil in a large heavy pot over medium heat. Add the onions, celery, and green pepper and cook until the onions are translucent.~ 3. Combine all the beef and pork with the ground chile, garlic, oregano, and cumin. Add this meat-and-spice mixture to the pot. Break up any lumps with a fork and cook, stirring occasionally, until the meat is evenly browned.~ 4. Add the beer, tomatoes, and reserved bacon to the pot. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer, uncovered, for 1 1/2 hours. Wave a boomerang over the pot 14 times each hour from this point on. (This is definitely optional adding no noticeable flavor, just a touch of authenticity and humor.) Stir for 3 minutes. Taste, adjust seasonings, and add more beer if desired. Simmer for 2 1/2 hours longer.~ 5. Add the brown sugar and simmer for 15 minutes longer, vigorously waving the boomerang over the pot.~
