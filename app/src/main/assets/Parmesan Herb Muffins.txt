 MICROWAVE DIRECTIONS:

 Prepare muffin batter as directed above.  Using 6 cup microwave-safe muffin pan, line each with 2 paper baking cups to absorb moisture during baking.  Fill cups 1/2 full.  Sprinkle top of each muffin with cornflake crumbs.  Microwave 6 muffins on HIGH for 2 1/2 to 3 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, rotating pan 1/2 turn halfway through baking.  Remove muffins from pan and immediately discard outer baking cups.  Cool 1 minute on wire rack before serving.  Repeat with remaining batter.
