--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1          2 lb  cabbage head
                        white pepper
       3          tbsp  mild vinegar -- (3 to 4)
       1            sm  pinch of sugar
       7                strips
                        medium-lean bacon -- cut
                        into small squares
                        salt and freshly ground

Cut the cabbage into quarters, remove the stem and tough outer leaves, and grate coarsely.  Add the grated cabbage to 4 quarts of boiling salted water and bring to a boil.  After 2 to 3 minutes, put in a colander to drain; shake it dry; press out the (66 min left), (H)elp, More? remaining liquid. While the cabbage is still lukewarm, put it into a salad bowl, sprinkle with vinegar, and mix well.  Allow this to sit for several minutes. Shortly before serving, cook the diced bacon until the fat has been rendered and pour the entire contents of the skillet (fat and bacon) over the salad.  Season to taste with salt, white pepper, and a little sugar. Makes 4 cups. (Note: If using red cabbage, add a Tbsp vinegar to the boiling water before adding the shredded cabbage.  This will set the color of the cabbage.  With red cabbage, many people prefer to substitute 1/3 cup salad oil for the bacon, which should be sprinkled cold over the still lukewarm (66 min left), (H)elp, More?         cabbage.)
