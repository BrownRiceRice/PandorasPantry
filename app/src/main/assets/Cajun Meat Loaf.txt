                        -------seasoning mix--------
       2         whole  bay leaves
       1      teaspoon  salt
       1      teaspoon  ground cayenne pepper
       1      teaspoon  black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  white pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
                        ------main ingredients------
       4   tablespoons  unsalted butter
     3/4           cup  finely chopped onions
     1/2           cup  green bell peppers, chopped
     1/4           cup  green onions, finely chopped
       2     teaspoons  minced garlic
       1    tablespoon  tabasco sauce
       1    tablespoon  worcestershire sauce
     1/2           cup  evaporated milk
     1/2           cup  catsup
   1 1/2        pounds  ground beef
     1/2         pound  ground pork
       2                eggs, lightly beaten
       1           cup  very fine bread crumbs

Combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl and set aside. Melt the butter in a 1-quart saucepan over medium heat. Add the onions, celery, bell peppers, green onions, garlic, tabasco, Worcestershire and seasoning mix. Saute until mixture starts sticking excessively, about 6 minutes, stirring occasionally and scraping the pan bottom well. Stir in the milk and catsup. Continue cooking for about 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat and allow mixture to cool to room temperature.  Place the ground beef and pork in an ungreased 13x9-inch baking pan. Add the eggs, the cooked vegetable mixture and the bread crumbs, remove the bay leaves. Mix by hand until thoroughly combined. In the center of the pan, shape the mixture into a loaf that is about 1-1/2 inches high, 6 inches wide and 12 inches long. Bake uncovered at 350F for 25 minutes, then raise heat to 400F and continue cooking until done, about 35 minutes longer. Serve immediately as is or with Very Hot Cajun Sauce for Beef.  This is best using both ground pork and ground beef, as the pork gives more flavor diversity. However, you can make it with ground beef only.
