*Dark deboned in chunks I divided recipe portions (above) to make it easier to pre-prepare. To make Sauce, mix cornstarch and water together. Add garlic , ginger, sugar, soy sauce, vinegar and wine. Then add broth and MSG and stir 'til sugar dissolves. Refrigerate 'til needed. In separate bowl mix chicken, soy sauce and pepper. Stir in egg. Add cornstarch until chicken is coated evenly. Add oil to help separate chicken pieces. Divide chicken in small quantities and deep-fry @ 350 until crispy and light brown. (Do not overcook; watch temp, stir fry or meat will toughen). Drain on paper towels. Place a small amount of oil in wok and heat 'til just hot. Add onions and peppers and stir-fry briefly (peppers will give off acrid smoke..be careful). Stir sauce; add to wok. Add chicken and cook just 'til sauce thickens.
