     1/2           cup  butter
       3        ounces  cream cheese
       1           cup  all-purpose flour
       1                egg
     3/4           cup  sugar
       2   tablespoons  butter -- softened
       1      teaspoon  vanilla
     1/2           cup  chopped walnuts
      72                fresh cranberries -- rinsed and drained

In a bowl, mix butter, cream cheese and flour with the fingers until a ball of dough is formed.  Cut dough into 24 pieces and place each piece into a muffing pan cup.

With the fingers press dough to line the bottom and sides of each cup.  In a bowl, mix egg, sugar, butter, vanilla and nuts.

Place 3 cranberries in each cup and spoon some egg mixture over cranberries, filling each cup to the tops.

bake in a preheated 325 degree oven for 20 to 25 minutes or until richly browned.  Cool in cups and then remove each tart by running the tip of a knife around edge.

Yield:  24 tarts.
