--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       2           cup  unbleached flour -- sifted
       3      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  shortening
       1           cup  sugar
       2         large  eggs
   1 1/3           cup  mashed ripe bananas (3 med.)
       1           cup  chopped walnuts

Sift together flour, baking powder and salt; set aside.

 Cream together shortening and sugar in bowl until light and fluffy, using electric mixer at medium speed.  Beat in eggs, one at a time, blending well after each addition.  Stir in mashed bananas.

 Add dry ingredients all at once, stirring just enough to moisten.  Gently mix in chopped nuts.  Spoon batter into greased 3-inch muffin-pan cups, filling 2/3rds full.

 Bake in 350 degree F. oven 20 minutes or until golden brown.  Serve hot with homemade jam or jelly.
