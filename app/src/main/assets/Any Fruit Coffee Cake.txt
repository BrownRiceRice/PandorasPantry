       4           Cup  Fruit
       1           Cup  Water
       2    Tablespoon  Lemon juice
   1 1/4           Cup  Sugar
     1/3           Cup  Cornstarch
       3           Cup  All-purpose flour
       1           Cup  Sugar
       1    Tablespoon  Baking powder
       1      Teaspoon  Salt
       1      Teaspoon  Ground cinnamon
     1/4      Teaspoon  Mace
       1           Cup  Butter
       2                Eggs -- Slightly beaten
       1           Cup  Milk
       1      Teaspoon  Vanilla
     1/2           Cup  Sugar
     1/2           Cup  All-purpose flour
     1/4           Cup  Butter
     1/2           Cup  Walnuts -- Chopped

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. 

 In a saucepan, combine choice of fruit and the water.  Simmer, covered, about 5 minutes or until fruit is tender.  Stir in lemon juice.  

Mix the 1 1/4 cups sugar and cornstarch; stir into fruit mixture.  Cook and stir until thickened and bubbly.  Cool.  

In a mixing bowl, stir together the 3 cups flour, 1 cup sugar, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and mace.  

Cut in the 1 cup butter until mixture resembles fine crumbs. 

Combine eggs, milk, and vanilla.  Add to flour mixture, mixing until blended.

Spread half of the batter into a greased 9x13 baking pan or two 8x8 baking pans.  Spread the cooled fruit mixture over the batter.  Spoon the remaining batter in small mounds over the fruit mixture, spreading out as much as possible.

Combine the 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup flour; cut in the 1/4 cup butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Stir in nuts.

Sprinkle nut mixture over batter in pan. Bake 45-50 minutes for a 9x13 pan or 40-45 minutes for the two 8x8 pans, or until cake tests done. Cool.
