--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  brown sugar
       1      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4           cup  white sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     3/4           cup  natural unsweetened
                        applesauce
       1           cup  rolled oats
       1           cup  sifted all purpose flour
     1/2           cup  seedless raisins

Mix sugars and add applesauce.  Sift together dry ingredients and stir in. Add oats and raisins.  Drop by spoonfuls onto lightly greased cookie sheet. Bake at 375 degrees about 10 minutes.

 Note:  I left out the raisins because I don't care for them. Also, I added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.  The next time I make these I may cut back on the sugar because they are rather sweet.  These cookies were nice and fluffy (for a fat-less cookie) and remind me of muffins.  These are so quick and easy to make, I just love them!  I hope everyone enjoys them.
