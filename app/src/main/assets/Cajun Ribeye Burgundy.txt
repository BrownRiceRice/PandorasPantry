       4                (6-ounce) beef rib eye steaks -- cut 1-inch thick
       3   tablespoons  Cajun spice mix
       1    tablespoon  olive oil
       2   tablespoons  fresh oregano -- chopped fine
       1    tablespoon  fresh thyme -- chopped fine

                        Salt and pepper to taste

Rub steaks on both sides with Cajun spice mix, adding salt and pepper to taste.

In a heavy skillet, preheated over high heat, quickly brown the steaks 2 minutes on each side. Remove steaks to platter.

Reduce heat to medium and add oil. Saute herbs and garlic in oil until fragrant and slightly brown.

Reduce heat to low and add Burgundy. When wine starts to bubble, return steaks to skillet. Reduce heat to a simmer. Cover and cook for 5 minutes.

Remove steaks to platter and keep warm. Boil liquid until reduced by half. Spoon sauce over steaks and serve.
