       1      teaspoon  minced garlic

       1      teaspoon  minced jalapeno pepper -- to taste
       1      teaspoon  ground cumin

                        Salt and pepper -- to taste
       4          cups  vegetable oil -- (approximately)
       6                warm whole-wheat pitas
       2          cups  shredded iceberg lettuce

                        --TAHINI SAUCE--
  1                cup  Tahini
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
  2             cloves  garlic -- peeled
                        Salt -- to taste
     1/2           cup  cool water -- (approximately)

Combine garbanzo beans, onion, garlic, parsley, cilantro, jalapeno pepper, cumin, baking powder, and salt and pepper in food processor fitted with a metal blade, using quick on-and-off turns. Do not puree.

Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes. When chilled, form garbanzo mixture into patties 2 inches round and about 3/4 of an inch thick. Set aside.

Heat oil in deep-sided frying pan over high heat. When hot, carefully lower patties into hot oil a few at a time using a slotted spoon. Fry for about 3 minutes, turning frequently, until patties are golden

Drain on a paper towel. Cut pitas in half. Place two falafel in each pocket and sprinkle with lettuce and drizzle with Tahini Sauce.

TAHINI SAUCE:
Place tahini, lemon juice, garlic and salt in food processor fitted with metal blade. Process until smooth, adding enough water to make a thin sauce. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.
