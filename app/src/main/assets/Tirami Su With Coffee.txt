--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       6                egg yolks
   1 1/4          cups  sugar
   1 1/4          cups  mascarpone cheese -- softened
      12        ounces  whipped cream or non dairy -- topping (cool whip)
   1 1/2          cups  espresso coffee -- cold
       4   tablespoons  brandy
                        powdered unsweetend cocoa
      48                ladyfingers (2-7 oz pks)

Cream yolks and sugar until smooth. Add mascarpone cheese and mix on low speed for 2 minutes. Fold in cream (or whipped topping). Combine coffee and brandy in a bowl. Dip 15 ladyfingers, one by one into brandy mixture and line up on a platter to make a rectangle about 7x13". Cover with 1/2 the mascarpone/cream mixture. Repeat with another layer and top with remaining cream mixture. Sift chocolate on top. With remaining ladyfingers, cut them in half and arrange around your rectangle with cut side down. The cream acts as a "glue".
