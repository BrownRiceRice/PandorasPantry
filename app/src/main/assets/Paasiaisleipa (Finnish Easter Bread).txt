  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       6          cups  all-purpose flour (6 to 6 1/2 cups)
     3/4           cup  sugar
       2      packages  Fleischmann's. Active Dry or Rapid Rise Ye
       2   tablespoons  orange peel
       2     teaspoons  lemon peel
       1      teaspoon  ground cardamom
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     3/4           cup  milk
     1/2           cup  water
     1/2           cup  butter or margarine
       2                eggs -- at room temperature
       1           cup  chopped dates or pitted dates -- snipped
     1/2           cup  chopped slivered almonds -- toasted
                        Confectioners' sugar frosting -- optional

In large bowl combine 1 1/2 cups flour, sugar, undissolved yeast, orange peel, lemon peel, cardamom and salt. Heat milk, water, and butter until very warm (120: to 130:F). Gradually add to dry ingredients and beat 2 minutes at medium speed of electric mixer, scraping bowl occasionally. Add eggs and 1/2 cup flour; beat at high speed 2 minutes, scraping bowl occasionally. Stir in enough additional flour to make soft dough. 

Knead on lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 8 to 10 minutes. Place in greased bowl, turning to grease top. Cover; let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 1 hour. (For Rapid Rise Yeast, cover kneaded dough; let rest on floured surface 10 minutes. Proceed with recipe.)

Punch dough down; turn out onto lightly floured surface. Knead in dates and almonds. Divide dough in half; shape into 2 balls. Place in 2 greased 8-inch round cake pans. Cover; let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.

Bake at 350:F for 35 to 40 minutes, or until done. Remove from pans; cool on wire racks. Top with confectioners' sugar frosting, if desired.
