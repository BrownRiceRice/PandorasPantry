     1/2         pound  ground beef
     1/4           cup  cold water
       2     teaspoons  minced onions
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  seasoned pepper
       4        slices  bacon -- cut in half
                        crosswise

Combine first 5 ingredients, mixing well; shape into 8 meatballs.  Roll bacon pieces around meatballs, and secure with toothpicks.  Saute over medium heat until bacon is crisp and brown; drain off fat.  If meatballs are not done, cover and simmer an additional 5 to 7 minutes.
