--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1 1/4         pound  fresh white or crimini (brown) mushrooms
       3   tablespoons  butter -- divided
       1           cup  coarsely chopped onions
       1       package  (about 4 cups) herb-seasoned stuffing mix
     1/2           cup  coarsely chopped walnuts
     1/2           cup  finely chopped sweet red bell pepper

Heat oven to 350 degrees. Trim and slice mushrooms. In a large skillet, over medium heat, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter. Add onions; cook and stir until tender, about 5 minutes. Spoon into large bowl.

Melt another tablespoon of the butter in the same skillet. Add half of the prepared mushrooms; cook and stir until golden, about 5 minutes; remove to the bowl with the onions.

Repeat with remaining butter and mushrooms. Add 2 cups water to skillet; stir to loosen browned bits; pour into mushroom mixture. Stir in stuffing mix, walnuts, pepper, and salt to taste.

Spoon into shallow 2 to 3 quart casserole. Bake until hot and crisp on top, about 45 minutes. Sprinkle with chopped parsley, if desired.
