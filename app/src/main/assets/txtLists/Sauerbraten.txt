Brown meat in hot vegetable oil in a Dutch oven.  Add the tomato and marinade liquid.  Cover and simmer gently 1 to 2 hours, until meat is tender.  Remove meat from juices.  Also remove peppercorns, cloves, and bay leaves.  Mix flour and sugar with water until lumps disappear.  Add to pan juices and cook until thickened.  Serve with boiled potatoes and red cabbage. Variations:  Meat can also be placed in a 325 degree oven and baked or it could be cooked on low in a slow cooker for 3 to 4 hours.
