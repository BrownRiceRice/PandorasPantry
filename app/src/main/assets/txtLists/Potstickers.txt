     2/3         pound  ground pork
       1           cup  chinese cabbage -- minced
       2                green onions -- minced
       1                egg
       1    tablespoon  light soy sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  orange peel -- grated
     1/2      teaspoon  hot chili oil
                        cornstarch
      40                won-ton wrappers -- cut into circles
     1/2           cup  peanut oil
       1           cup  water

Combine port, cabbage, onion, egg, soy sauce, salt, orange peel and hot chili oil in large bowl and mix well. To assemble:  Dust waxed or parchment paper with cornstarch.  Set 1 rounded teaspoon filling in center of won tom skin, pressing lightly so filling forms narrow band across middle. Moisten rim of skin.  Bring opposite sides together to form semicircle.  Pinch together around outer edge.  Transfer to cornstarch dusted paper.  Cover with dry kitchen towel. Repeat with remaining won ton and filling.  Place two heavy 12" skillets over low heat.  Add 1/4 cup oil to each. Arrange dumplings in skillets in rows, fitting closely together.  Increase heat to medium-high and cook uncovered until bottoms are deeply golden, about 2 minutes, checking occasionally.  Add 1/2 cup water to each pan and cover immediately.  Let steam until skins are translucent, about 3 minutes.  Remove cover and continue cooking over medium to medium-high heat until bottoms are very crisp and well browned.  Drain off excess oil if necessary.  Loosen dumplings with spatula and transfer to serving dish.  Serve immediately.
