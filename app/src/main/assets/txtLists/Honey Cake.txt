       1         pound  honey
       1           cup  sugar
       3                eggs
       2          cups  coffee
       4          cups  flour (all purpose)
       4     teaspoons  baking powder
       1      teaspoon  baking soda
       1      teaspoon  allspice
       1      teaspoon  cinnamon
       1      teaspoon  ginger
     1/2      teaspoon  nutmeg
     1/4         pound  raisins
       2        ounces  almonds -- cut lengthwise

Beat eggs till light.  Add sugar and beat till thick. Beat in the honey and add all the dry ingredients alternately with the coffee. Add the raisins and pour into an oiled or greased large pan. Sprinkle with almonds and bake in a moderate oven for about 1/2 to 3/4 hour. This makes almost 3 pounds of cake.
