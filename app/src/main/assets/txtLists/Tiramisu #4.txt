       1                lady fingers -- hard
       8                egg yolks
     1/4           cup  sugar
       1         pound  mascarpone cheese
       2          cups  cream heavy
       2          cups  coffee -- strong cooled
       2   tablespoons  sugar
       2        ounces  kahlua
       2        ounces  rum

Whip heavy cream until stiff. Whip egg yolks with 1/4 cup sugar until pale yellow. Add mascarpone and whip until mixed well. Whip in the stiffly beaten heavy cream until all is mixed well. Use almost any size container, usually a 9 x 13 clear dish. Put half of the cheese mixture on the bottom, spreading evenly. Mix the coffee with the kahlua, rum and 2 tbls sugar. Soak the lady fingers, with the coffee mix, one at a time, until they absorb some of the liquid, but still feel a little crisp. Place the soaked lady fingers over the cheese layer in the dish. Top with the rest of the cheese mixture and smooth over all with the back of a spoon. Coarsely chop some bittersweet chocolate and sprinkle it over the top. Let stand chilled at least 6 hours before serving.
