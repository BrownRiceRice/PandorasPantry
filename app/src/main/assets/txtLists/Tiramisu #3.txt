--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1                sponge cake -- 3 inch tall
       3        ounces  coffee -- strong
       3        ounces  kahlua
       8        ounces  cream cheese
   1 1/2          cups  powdered sugar
                        cocoa powder

Cut the cake across the middle to form 2 halves. Blend the coffee and kahlua together. Sprinkle the one half of the cake with the coffee and kahlua mix, enough to strongly flavor the cake, but do not saturate the cake so much that it collapses. Mix the cream cheese and sugar, beating until light and spreadable. Spread over this half of the cake in a fairly thick layer. Set the other half on top of this. Repeat the process. Put the cocoa powder in a wire strainer and coat the top layer of cream cheese completely with cocoa. Refrigerate the cake for at least 2 hours before serving. May use favorite liqueur or rum or brandy instead of kahlua.
