--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   2 1/2          cups  whole-wheat flour
     1/2           cup  nonfat dry milk -- powdered
       1      teaspoon  sugar
       1      teaspoon  salt
       6   tablespoons  margarine
       1                egg

Mix ingredients with about 1/2 cup of cold water.  Knead for 3 minutes. Dough should form a ball.  Roll to 1/2" thick and cut with dog bone cookie cutters (or whatever you prefer).  Bake on a lightly greased cookie sheet for 30 minutes at 350 degrees F.

Optional ingredients:

Add powdered chicken or beef bouillon or dried soup greens or dried soup mix.  If you add these, I would eliminate the 1 teas. of salt.
