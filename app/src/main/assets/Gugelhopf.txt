--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1       package  yeast; dry active
       1           cup  milk; scalded then cooled
       1           cup  sugar
       1           cup  butter or margarine
       5                eggs; large
       1      teaspoon  vanilla extract
       1    tablespoon  lemon rind (rind of 1 lemon)
     3/4           cup  raisins
     1/3           cup  almonds; ground (2 oz pk)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
       4          cups  flour; unbleached, unsifted

Sprinkle yeast into milk to dissolve.  In a large bowl beat sugar and butter until light and fluffy.  Beat in eggs, one at a time.  Stir in vanilla, lemon rind, raisins, and almonds.  Mix salt and flour.  Add milk and flour mixtures, alternately, ending with the flour mixture. Grease a gugelhopf mold*, Bundt pan, or tube pan.  Pour batter into pan.  Cover and let rise until doubled in bulk, about 2 hours.  Bake in preheated 375 degree F. Oven for 40 minutes or until browned and done.  Serve warm with butter. *  The gugelhopf mold is know also as a turban-head pan.  If this is not available, you can use the others with the same results.
