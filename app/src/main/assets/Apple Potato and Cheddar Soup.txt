       2   tablespoons  vegetable oil 3 medium Granny Smith apples -- peeled, cored, and
                        chopped
       1                potato -- peeled and chopped
       1         stalk  celery -- chopped
     1/4           cup  finely chopped onion
     1/8      teaspoon  ground thyme
     1/4           cup  white wine
       5          cups  chicken broth
       4          cups  grated cheddar cheese
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
     1/8      teaspoon  nutmeg
     1/8      teaspoon  white pepper
                        Diced unpeeled apple (optional)

In large saucepot, heat oil. Add apples, potato, celery, onion, and thyme. Saute 10 minutes. Stir in wine and simmer 2 minutes; add broth and simmer 45 minutes. 

In blender or food processor, puree soup mixture. Return to saucepot; over very low heat, stir in cheese, cream, nutmeg, and pepper. Cook just until heated through--do not boil or cheese will curdle. Ladle soup into serving bowls and garnish, if desired, diced apples.
