       1         pound  Fresh Mushrooms
       1          pint  Stewing Oysters
       1          pint  Boiling Cream
       1         ounce  Butter
       4         large  Egg Yolks
       3   tablespoons  Sherry Wine -- good

                        Cayenne Pepper -- to taste

Clean, drain, and quarter mushrooms. Place them in a frying pan and cook until a golden color. Add oysters and cook five minutes. Pour in cream. Season with salt and cayenne pepper. Mix well. Boil 10 minutes.

Beat together egg yolks and sherry wine. Little by little, add this to the oysters while constantly stirring with a wooden spoon. Remove just before it comes to the boiling point. Add butter and stir until melted. Serve with toast.
