       1        Medium  Squash, Cushaw
                        Cold Water
     1/2         Stick  Butter
       1           Cup  Sugar
       1    Tablespoon  Cinnamon
       1    Tablespoon  Nutmeg

(a variety of crookneck squash of the gourd family)

Cushaw is not as difficult to prepare for cooking as most recipes read.  Remove ends.  Halve lengthwise, then cut into long narrow strips.  Peel, removing the green meat next to the skin.  Cut crosswise into 1" chunks.

Place in a large kettle and cover with unsalted cold water.  Cook over medium heat until tender - about 15 minutes - when pricked with a fork.  Drain well in colander then pat a little with paper towels.

Immediately place half of the cushaw in a 1 qt. casserole dish.  Chip half of butter and dot over cushaw.

Mix sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg and sprinkle 1/3 of this over the cushaw.

Gently place the remaining half of the cumshaw on top and dot with the other half of the butter.  sprinkle with the rest of the spice mixture.

Mix slightly with care, as the cumshaw will break up easily.

Bake in preheated 350 degree oven for about an hour or until nicely browned and topping is somewhat crusty.
